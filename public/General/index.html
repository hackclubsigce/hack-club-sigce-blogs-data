<h1 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Adobe a new dimension to editing!</h1>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The average attention span of a Human is about 8.25 seconds. That&apos;s make the graphic job more difficult and challenging. The task to quickly draw someone&apos;s attention and to keep them attentive, is what most graphic designers are facing these days.</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>And here comes the Adobe! You heard me. The savior of the editing world. The hero without a cape! And there are indeed plenty of reasons, as to why I am saying this. It&apos;s not like they paid me or anything (Arghh, why didn&apos;t they!), but I myself found it very useful and a must having thing!</p>
<h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>EVER HEARD OF ADOBE?</h2>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Adobe Inc is an <b>American multinational computer software</b>company, which over the years have developed numerous software and applications for graphic creation and manipulation. In simpler terms, they create software that helps in the editing work of any kind of graphics, it may be photos or videos.</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Adobe is not just one software or application, instead it is a whole army of such. There are different software/applications for different kind of things. There is always some uniqueness that each of this product have for themselves and that is what makes them very sustainable in the current global market.</p>
<h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Creative Cloud, a new world!</h2>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Adobe is a deep-rooted brand that offers you a ton of apps and software which makes you limitless in the world of productivity and content creation.</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Some of them are,</p>
<ul class='fs-5 mb-4'>
  <li>Photoshop</li>
  <li>Lightroom</li>
  <li>Illustrator</li>
  <li>Adobe XD</li>
  <li>After Effects</li>
  <li>Premiere Pro</li>
  <li>Acrobat Pro</li>
</ul>
<h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>IT HAS ITS OWN ECOSYSTEM!</h2>
</p class='fs-5 mb-4'> There are ton of instances where one needs to work on a project but by using many <b>devices</b> at once. Now it&apos;s not a smart move to start from scratch every time you switch the device. </p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Sometimes, a group of people has to work on a certain project and it&apos;s not efficient to conduct offline meets and doing it on a single device. And my friend, if you are relating to this, then Adobe is your savior!</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Using the creative cloud, you can access projects on many devices simultaneously. With adobe you can sync many devices together. Any changes made on one device; will reflect onto all the devices that you have connected. So, a group of people could work together saving a lot of time. So convenient, isn&apos;t it?</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>To know more about the synchronization feature, I have the official link <a href='https://helpx.adobe.com/in/creative-cloud/help/sync-creative-cloud-files.html'>HERE</a></p>
<h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Networking the adobe!</h2>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Syncing is one fraction of a feature. Let me present the handiest and lifesaving feature, “Integrating and plug ins”. </p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Now many of us and our friends use third party apps or more than one <b>application</b> to work on a single project. And sometimes it becomes hectic to just keep exporting one project among different software. </p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Guess what! Your guy adobe is here. Adobe gives you the power to connect various productive apps, collaborative tools and other design tools to its creative cloud. And believe the amount of time and clicks you can save is just amazing.</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Now, I am talking here about different <b>software</b> and not different <b>devices</b>! Although, we have covered that previously.</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Here is the <a href='https://www.adobe.com/in/creativecloud/extensibility.html'>LINK</a>, if you want to know more about it.</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Maintaining the workflow is the key, my friend!”</p>
<h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>PRICING AND PREMIUMS</h2>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Now, let&apos;s get down to the business. Are they offering their services free? Absolutely not, but absolutely yes! Fuzzy now, isn&apos;t it? The company isn&apos;t making just one software, and it is expected that not everything is going to be free of cost. </p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>But wait, there are certain things that the Adobe has provided for free. And they are more than enough to give a glimpse of what they hold for our future!</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Some of the free applications/software (subject to change): -</p>
<ul class='fs-5 mb-4'>
  <li>Adobe Photoshop for iPad</li>
  <li>Photoshop</li>
  <li>Adobe Creative Cloud Express</li>
  <li>Photoshop Mix</li>
  <li>Lightroom mobile cc</li>
  <li>Adobe Premiere Rush</li>
  <li>Illustrator Draw </li>
  <li>Adobe XD</li>
  <li>Adobe Color</li>
  <li>Adobe Acrobat Reader</li>
</ul>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Some of their features are free to use while other features are the paid ones! Depending upon the needs of required tools, one can decide to choose from a number of premiums they are offering</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Here, is the <a href='https://www.adobe.com/in/creativecloud/plans.html?promoid=P3KMQYMW&mv=other'>LINK</a> to the plans and pricing that the company offers.</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>&lsquo;<i>But I am not sure whether it will be worth it or not.</i>&rsquo; And my fellow reader, if you are having questions like this, then worry not because Adobe presents &lsquo;free trials&rsquo; and that too a lot of them! You can have a free trial of most of the software they are providing for 7-14 days (might change). And they are providing it because of their confidence on their products! So, why not we check that for ourself?</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Here is your <a href='https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html'>LINK</a> to the free trial page! Check it out, use it and <b>WA-LA!</b> </p>
<h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>FEATURES AND TOOLS</h2>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Now that we have discussed about the pricing, let&apos;s explore the features and tools that we are getting. Will it be worth that much? Let&apos;s find out!</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>But before that, just FYI the post for this blog is made using photoshop only! And while my friend was making the post, I asked him that what he likes the most about the Adobe Photoshop. He answered me, he loves everything about it! And what exactly he met by that is right up ahead!</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>Cloud Storage</b> is something we all are aware now. We know how important it is to have such a thing. In order to access one project over many devices, or many software, cloud storage comes into the play. It also avails you to store your project without ever worrying about anything.</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>Flexibility</b>, there are very few things that you can&apos;t do using Adobe. The controls you get are massive and powerful. Every software and application come with their own features and tools. Photoshop has tools like layering, selection tool, pen tool, AI assisted tools, etc.</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>Artificial intelligence</b>, machine learning and deep learning are powering the products and software of Adobe. Adobe uses these technologies to understand the content (images, videos, docs, audio and more...). And then the software uses the data to provide various recommendation, personalization, generation of the content, etc.</p>
  <img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id43/id43.png'>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The team of Adobe is constantly working over the new technologies (like Ai and ML) to help the content creators work more quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Interestingly, they are looking for Engineers, researchers and interns for their research team. You can check it out over <a href='https://research.adobe.com/careers/'>HERE</a>!</p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Adobe Stock is another of the amazing thing the company is providing. Here, you can access and use millions of photos, videos, and more… for your content. Just search what you are looking for and BOOM! You can check that in this <a href='https://stock.adobe.com/in/photos'>LINK</a>. </p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>And there are hundreds of tools to use from, so as to increase the quality of your project and product. And its indeed understandable that we can&apos;t go through each one of it. So, let&apos;s wrap it up here!</p>
<h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>I hope you guys got a basic idea about Adobe Inc, their products and the work they are doing for the society. Using their products, we can definitely increase the quality of our projects, content, etc... Moreover, we will get to learn about the new technologies and we can get a glimpse of the future in it. </p>
<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Not only that, but it is also beneficial for our team and organization as well. Hope you all found this blog useful and interesting. Will bring such similar blogs in the near future! Till then KEEP LEARNING AND KEEP GROWING.</p>
