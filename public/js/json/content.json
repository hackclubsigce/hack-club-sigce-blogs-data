      "shortDesc": "Install Kali Linux as a Portable Live USB for Pen-Testing & Hacking on Any Computer",
      "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-3'>&emsp;Kali Linux is the go-to Linux distribution for penetration testing and ethical hacking. Still, it's not recommended for day-to-day use, such as responding to emails, playing games, or checking Facebook. That's why it's better to run your Kali Linux system from a bootable USB drive.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>The hacker-friendly Debian-based distro did receive a major update by Offensive Security in late-2019 that changed the default desktop environment from the heavyweight Gnome to a more lightweight Xfce, making Kali more snappy and responsive overall. But we still can't recommend it as your daily driver unless you hack 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Using Kali in a dual-boot situation is the way to go if you have a dedicated machine, but for something more portable, the live version on a USB flash drive is what you want. If you have a spare computer that you're going to be using for your white-hat endeavors only, then yes, by all means, install Kali as the primary system so that you can take full use of the computer's hardware. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-3 mt-5'>What You'll Need :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>&emsp;To follow along, you'll need a USB flash drive. You could get away with using one as small as 4 GB for the basics or 8 GB if you want persistence, but a larger one may come in handy, especially if you want the ability to save data. When it comes to 4 GB USB sticks, you'll mostly only find USB 2.0 speeds unless you spend a crazy amount of money on an Kingston IronKey or iStorage datAshur Pro with 256-bit encryption.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>You'll also need the Kali Live ISO file and an imaging program like Etcher or Rufus, which we'll outline below.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-1 : Download the Right Kali Linux Version</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>While there are many different types of Kali Linux images, the one we want for a portable live version is the \"Live\" download. You can choose between 64-Bit for AMD (for Intel chips), 64-Bit for ARM64 (such as the M1 chips in newer Macs), and 32-Bit for i386 (which you likely won't ever use because it's so outdated).</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Visit <a target=\"_blank\" href='kali.org/downloads'>Kali</a> and download the appropriate Live image. We'll be using the 64-Bit for AMD since we're using an Intel Chip. No matter which one you choose, note that you will only be able to use the Xfce desktop environment, and you won't be able to specify additional (meta)packages to install.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id2/id2.1.jpg\"/></div><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-2 : Install a USB Formatting Tool</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>On Linux and macOS computers, you could use the dd command to copy over the Kali Live image to the USB drive, but you always run the risk of choosing the wrong drive and royally screwing yourself over by overwriting an important drive. Because of that, we recommend using a USB formatting tool. If you're on Windows, Rufus is a good tool, but Etcher works for Linux, macOS, and Windows, so we're using that.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Head to balena.io/etcher and his the \"Download\" button, which should detect which system you're on ad give you the right version. If not, hit the drop-down button next to it to choose your OS. Once downloaded, install it like you would any other app. For example, on macOS, open the DMG, drag balenaEtcher over to your Applications folder, then eject the DMG and delete it.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id2/id2.2.jpg\"/></div><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-3 : Flash the Kali Live Image to the Flash Drive</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Open Etcher, then click on \"Select Image.\" You may see options for \"Flash from file\" and \"Flash from URL\" instead; choose \"Flash from file\" if you see that.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id2/id2.3.jpg\"/></div><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Navigate to the Kali image you downloaded in Step 1, and select it. Then, you need to click on \"Select Target\" to choose your USB flash drive. Double- and triple-check that you're selecting the right drive by looking at the drive name and space available.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id2/id2.4.jpg\" /></div><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Now all that's left to do is click on \"Flash!\" This will reformat your flash drive so that everything will be erased and overwritten with the Kali Live image.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id2/id2.5.jpg\"/></div><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>You may be asked to input your admin password to let Etcher do its magic, so go ahead and do that if it happens. Then, Etcher will show a progress bar indicating how much time is left for flashing the content over. You'll see a \"Flash Complete\" message when it's done.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id2/id2.6.jpg\"/></div><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-4 : Boot from the Kali Live USB</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Now it's time to boot to your new Kali Live USB flash drive, but the process will vary based on the computer brand, operating system, and processor.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>On macOS, it's much easier. If you have an Apple M1 chip, just power down your Mac, then turn it on and hold the power button until you see the startup window. On Intel-based Macs, press the Option key immediately after turning on or restarting the computer until you see the startup window. Then, just select the Kali Live flash drive to boot from.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>To find out how to enter BIOS and change the boot settings, and/or load the startup menu, google \"boot from USB drive\" for your computer model and OS and find the appropriate instructions. There are just too many to list here where there are plenty of good manuals online with instructions for booting from external disks.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-5 : Choose How You Want to Boot Kali</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Once you've booted into the Kali Live USB flash drive, you should see a few different options for which version of Kali you want to load. They may include:</p><ul class=\"fs-5 mb-3\"> <li><strong>Live system</strong> : This will boot up Kali Live. In this mode, you cannot save any changes. No reports, no logs, no other data — none of these changes are saved. This way, you start with a fresh Kali Live every time you boot it up. Data is only saved to RAM, not the drive.</li><li><strong>Live system (fail-safe mode)</strong> : Same as the live system, but a more robust version in case the system fails. That way, the failed system won't ruin your flash drive. This is a good option if you need to troubleshoot a problematic computer.</li><li><strong>Live system (forensic mode): </strong> : Same as the live system with forensic-friendly tools so that you can recover files, gather evidence, and perform other forensic tasks on a host machine. However, the internal hard drive is never touched, and external devices and media will not auto-mount so that you have complete control over what you can connect to.</li><li><strong>Live system (persistence) : </strong> Same as the live system, only changes will be saved, and it will allow you to inspect the host system without worrying about running or locked processes.</li><li><strong>Live system (encrypted persistence): </strong> Same as the live system (persistence), only encrypted with LUKS, so it's harder for others to access your data.</li><li><strong>Live system (encrypted persistence): </strong> Same as the live system (persistence), only encrypted with LUKS, so it's harder for others to access your data.</li><li><strong>Start installer: </strong> This lets you start the installer to install Kali on an internal drive.</li><li><strong>Start installer with speech synthesis: </strong> Same as start installer, only with speech instructions to help navigate.</li><li><strong>Advanced options: </strong> Includes options such as MemTest, Hardware Detection, etc..</li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>To boot it up without saving any changes, just choose the \"Live system\" option, which will take you right into the new Xfce desktop environment as a non-root user. However, if you want to save your changes, boot using \"Live system (persistence)\" or \"Live system (encrypted persistence)\" instead.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-6 : Set Up Persistence on Kali Live</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Choosing one of the persistence options doesn't mean it'll work out of the box. There is some configuration to perform first, mainly creating a new partition to save all your data. Kali has some excellent instructions on doing so, which we are using.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>To create a partition above the Kali Live partitions, ending at 7 GB, issue the following three commands in a terminal window as the kali user, which will keep the Live options in the 7 GB partition, freeing up the rest for your data storage. Make sure you're doing this from your Kali Live system you just booted into.</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ end=7GiB\n~$ read start _ &#60; &#60;(du -bcm kali-linux-2021.1-live-arm64.iso | tail -1); echo $start\n~$ parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary ${start}MiB $end</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>When that's done, you should now have a third partition labeled something like /dev/sdb3 or /dev/disk1s3. Check your volume identifier because you'll need it for the rest of this process.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>If you want to add some encryption in case you think someone might get a hold of your drive, issue the following two commands as kali. Type \"YES\" in all caps if prompted to proceed with overwriting the new partition. When asked for a passphrase, choose one and enter it twice. You can skip encryption if you don't want it.</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ cryptsetup --verbose --verify-passphrase luksFormat /dev/sdb3\n~$ cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb3 my_usb</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Next, run the following two commands as kali to create an ext3 file system labeled \"persistence.\" If you chose to skip encryption, use these:</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ mkfs.ext3 -L persistence /dev/sdb3\n~$ e2label /dev/sdb3 persistence</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Next, run the following two commands as kali to create an ext3 file system labeled \"persistence.\" If you chose to skip encryption, use these:</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ mkfs.ext3 -L persistence /dev/sdb3\n~$ e2label /dev/sdb3 persistence</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>If you encrypted the partition, use:</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ mkfs.ext3 -L persistence /dev/mapper/my_usb\n~$ e2label /dev/mapper/my_usb persistence</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Next, create a mount point, mount the new partition there, create a configuration file to enable persistence, then unmount the partition. If you didn't encrypt the partition, use : </p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ mkdir -p /mnt/my_usb\n~$ mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt/my_usb\n~$ echo \"/ union\" > /mnt/my_usb/persistence.conf\n~$ umount /dev/sdb3</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>If you encrypted the partition, use : </p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ mkdir -p /mnt/my_usb/\n~$ mount /dev/mapper/my_usb /mnt/my_usb\n~$ echo \"/ union\" > /mnt/my_usb/persistence.conf\n~$ umount /dev/mapper/my_usb</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>If you didn't encrypt the partition, you're done. If you did, you have one more command to issue as kali, which will close the encrypted channel for the new partition : </p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/my_usb</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Now, reboot into Kali Live and choose the appropriate system, and everything should be all set.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-7 : Add a Password for the Root User</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>On new versions of Kali, you're a non-root user by default, but you can issue root commands as a regular user by using:</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ sudo su</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>If you're asked for a password, use kali. However, Kali Live might not attach a password to the root user, so you'll have to create one if you don't want other people to get in and mess with your system. If it does have one, you can change it to something better. Use passwd root with root privileges to do that. Enter your chosen password, then verify it.</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~# passwd \n\nrootNew password:Retype \nnew password: \n\npasswd: password updated successfully</code></pre>",

      "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>I am quite sure we all know who Mr. Elon Musk is! But for the record Elon Reeve Musk FRS is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let us travel back a year behind, if someone says Elon Musk the first thing that came to our mind was Tesla or SpaceX. But now if we hear the name Elon Musk the first thing that comes to our mind is Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency. That is what Mr. Musk has changed in past 1 year. What is Cryptocurrency though? Well A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as a medium of exchange. Individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Why is Elon Musk a Crypto Wizard?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well apart from building spaceships and sending cars into space or creating worlds most advance electric vehicles. Elon Musk has a reputation of playing with the crypto market. Every time Mr. Musk has tweeted something regarding crypto currencies the crypto market has reacted and changed drastically. But what actually happened ?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>On 4th June 2021 Mr. Musk sitting on his expensive sofa just tweeted a breakup heart emoji with #BITCOIN.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>But what can a tweet really do?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well, the value of Bitcoin sank from $64,000 to $30,000 in 1 night. Yes, that’s a steep fall especially for heavy bitcoin investors.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id5/id5.1.png'/><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Along with Bitcoin even Ethereum and Dogecoin fell.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well, this was not the first time where such a thing happened. In May Mr. Musk said that Tesla will not be accepting any payments in Bitcoins due to heavy energy usage. Due to this the whole cryptocurrency market fell in one day.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Elon Musk tweeted that he owns only 3 crypto currencies I.E. </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>On 25th October 2021.</p><ol class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Bitcoin</li><li>Ethereum</li><li>Dogecoin</li></ol><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>This is the sole reason these 3 are the highest performing cryptos. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>But why can Elon Musk control the whole Crypto market ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The main reason is he owns two largest powerhouses that accepts payments in the form of cryptocurrencies. It is also because of his social media influence and impact of his opinion on crypto markets.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>So make sure you check twitter before investing in crypto market next time !</p>",

Let's look into the technical terms based on which the actual code runs. Focusing sequentially on </p><ol class='fs-5 mb-5'> <li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>JavaScript</li></ol><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>HTML :</h2><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>What is HTML ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Structure of HTML Element</h2><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/Web-Dev/id6/id6.1.jpg' ><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>To provide additional information to the HTML element there is a concept called HTML attributes.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>HTML Attributes:</h2><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>HTML attributes are the special words which provide additional information to the HTML element.</li><li>Each element or tag can have their own attributes</li><li>There are few attributes which are known as global attributes, since they can be applied to any element present in the HTML document. e.g., style, class, id, title, etc.</li><li>Attribute names are case sensitive and should be written in lowercase only.</li><li>There can be multiple attributes in the same element.</li></ul><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/Web-Dev/id6/id6.2.png' ><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>CSS Syntax :</h2><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/Web-Dev/id6/id6.3.png'><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>What Is CSS ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>JavaScript :-</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable : </p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>var</li><li>let</li><li>const</li></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>var :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Variable is a container that is used for storing data (values). It basically works like math algebra wherein, you assign values. <br>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>var x=5;<br>var y=6;<br>var z = x + y;<br>//Apparently, var z will store the value 11.</code></pre>All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.These unique names are called identifiers.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>let :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>let can declare the JS variable in the same way as we did with “var”. Just the case with “let” is that it does not let you re-declare a variable that is already declared.<br>Eg - <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>let x = \"HackClub\";<br>let x = \"7\";<br>// SyntaxError : ‘x’ has already been declared.</code></pre> </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>const :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In const you can’t re-declare or re-assign a declared variable. JS const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.<br>Eg - <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>const dec = 12;</code></pre> As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>JS DataTypes : </h2> <ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>String : A string ( or a text string ) is a series of characters like “sunny day”.</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>let quote = 'The best way to predict the future is to create it.';</code></pre> <li>JS Numbers : JavaScript has only one type of numbers. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>let y = 69;<br>let z = 07;</code></pre> <li>JS Booleans : Booleans only have 2 values. It is used when you have only 2 values like yes/no, true/false, on/off.</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\">let x = 7;<br>let y = 8;<br>let z = 7;<br>( x == y ) // returns false.<br>( x == z ) // returns true.<code></code></pre> <li>JS Arrays : Array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value. An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.</li>Syntax : <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];</code></pre> <li>JS Objects : It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>const person = {name:'John', age: 23, height:'5.9 feet'};</code></pre> <li>JS Undefined : In JS, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>let pool; // Value is undefined, type will also be undefined.</code></pre> <li>Empty values : Empty values does not imitate “undefined”, it is a different data type</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>let pool=''; // The value is '', the typeof is 'string'.</code></pre></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>JS Functions :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Imagine If a person has to make a call in the evening. The first thing he will do is set a reminder which will alert him about the call in the evening. In the same way a function generally works. JS Function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task and it is executed when “something” invokes it (calls it).</p>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>function myFunction(p1, p2){<br>    return p1 * p2; // The function returns the product of p1 and p2<br>}</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets:{}</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Function Invocation : </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will 'return' to execute the code after the invoking statement.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Functions often compute a return value. The return value is 'returned' back to the 'caller'.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Why Functions?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results”.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The () Operator Invokes the Function</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Note : Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>FRAMEWORKS :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Web Application Framework or simply “web framework” is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Frameworks are, in short, libraries that help you develop your application faster and smarter!</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Web FrameWorks like “BOOTSTRAP”, “SEMANTIC UI”, “TAILWIND”, “MATERIALIZE CSS”, etc are generally based on HTML, CSS and JS which helps in creating intriguing, responsive and interactive web designs.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>JS LIBRARIES :</h2><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li> <h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>What is a JavaScript Library?</h2> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>A library is a JavaScript file that contains a bunch of functions, and those functions accomplish some useful tasks for your webpage. Most libraries have documentation with a list of available functions or a real-world example.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Some of the most preferred JS libraries are JQuery, AngularJS, Vue.JS, ReactJS, they also allow developers to create scalable single-page websites.</p></li></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>This might lead to a question: </h2> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>What is the difference between a Framework and a Library?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>“Front-End is all about being technically creative while delivering a responsive web design”</h2>",

Here the model needs to find the hidden patterns from the dataset by itself to get trained. This model is trained based on an unlabeled dataset.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In simple terms, this is analogous to a student not being trained using solved examples by the teacher but instead, the student has to train himself using unsolved examples and find its solutions.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>As this student does not need a teacher, similarly our model does not need any kind of supervision here.

This image data is unlabeled or uncategorized. Now, these images are passed to the model, but here only the input data(i.e images) are passed whereas output data(labels like cat or dog) is not passed. Also, no features are already provided to the model while the training process, rather the model has to identify the features by itself.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/AI-ML/id8/id8.1.png' ><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Here by features I mean that the above characteristics of these two animals differentiate them as cats or dogs.

Once these features of cats and dogs are identified by the model, its task is to separate these two types of images into different clusters. Once the hidden patterns are identified now it selects the appropriate unsupervised machine learning algorithm such as k-means clustering, Apriori algorithm, KNN Classification, etc and then classifies the images with similar features as part of one cluster(or group) and the dissimilar images as part of another cluster(or group).</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/AI-ML/id8/id8.2.png' ><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Similarly, the cats and dogs are grouped into two different clusters by applying the suitable algorithm and now after clustering, labels are assigned to these clusters(i.e one cluster belongs to cats and the other cluster belongs to dogs).</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Another Example:</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Here various shapes are provided as input data to the model as raw data for identifying the hidden patterns from the data.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/AI-ML/id8/id8.3.png' ><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>After that, a suitable algorithm is applied and the shapes are categorized into different clusters labeled as triangle, cube, and circle.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Below is the difference between a supervised machine learning algorithm and an unsupervised machine learning algorithm:</h3><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/AI-ML/id8/id8.4.png' ><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In supervised Machine Learning, input data (images of apple) along with the labels is passed to the model and the model is trained based on these images and labels.

Hence, you can observe that eggs, butter, jam, etc are always kept beside bread in malls and supermarkets as a marketing strategy. This is called Market Basket Analysis which helps to develop relationships between various products.Another example can be people who have bought a new house are more likely to buy new furniture.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Types of Association Algorithms</h3><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Apriori Algorithm</li><li>FP Growth Algorithm</li><li>Eclat</li></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Advantages:</h2><ol class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Used to gain better insights from the data.</li><li>It works with unlabeled and uncategorized data.</li><li>In the real world, we don't always have the output to the corresponding input data.

CSS is a style sheet language used for presentation of a website written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4'>What is BOOTSTRAP ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Bootstrap is a free and open source CSS framework…..Yes bootstrap is evolved from CSS ! It contains CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4'>As a beginner in programming 🧑‍💻 what should you learn first?</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>These are my personal views different people suit different approaches, but I think CSS is the one you should learn first. It is very important to learn the basics first and to strengthen your roots. Bootstrap doesn't really require any learning or practice, a person with basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript can also work with Bootstrap flawlessly.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4'>What should you use 🤔?</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Your decision totally depends upon what project you are working on.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>If you are working on a project that requires less customization and has a limited time period than Bootstrap is your go to option. Customization is limited in Bootstrap but you can quickly create websites using Bootstrap.</li><li>If your project requires a client specific design and features than Bootstrap would be a little difficult to execute. CSS is the best option for such projects. Though this method would be time consuming, but a good team can execute it in no time.</li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>These were some points regarding CSS v/s Bootstrap, I hope I have cleared your doubts, nevertheless use the language you are comfortable with, cause at the end of the day the client only requires his desired output. </p>",

But this is true……. with some practice and wordpress you can achieve this goal.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>So what is this magic tool wordpress? Lets make it simple it is basically a website designing tool. WordPress (WP, WordPress.org) is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Using wordpress anyone with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript can build a great website! It includes plugin architecture and template systems which is called as themes in wordpress.</p><h1 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Difference between wordpress.com and wordpress.org :</h1><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>wordpress.com :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>This is a profit-oriented website. It is a hosting service and it is paid. It is easier to use but you do not have that freedom and flexibility of a self - hosted website.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>wordpress.org :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>This is a self - hosted wordpress, when someone talks about wordpress most of the time they are referring to wordpress.org.

      "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is not just like white fluffy things in the sky…</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Before proceeding further, we must understand the term which is cloud.</p><h2 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>What is Cloud?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>'The term Cloud' can be considered as a global network of remote server access over the internet, where the software and databases run together. Before the concept of Cloud Computing came into the picture, each company managed their physical servers and access services from their own machines. Because of that they faced a lot of problems like high maintenance cost, security issues, unreliability, data loss and many more.</p><h2 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>Cloud Computing</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Cloud computing is a technology which stores and access services - including servers, database, networking, software, analytics & intelligence over the internet in the place of your computer's hard drive. In simple term Instead of storing and accessing the services from your personal computer, you are accessing them over the internet by using any internet dependent device.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let's take an example, Email is an online communication service, like Gmail. If you use Gmail, you are not hosting your own email server. Google is hosting it, and you are just accessing it through your user device as a client. It works same with large companies when they switch to cloud computing it will reduce cost for storage, improve performance and speed, more reliability with high security.</p><h2 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>Types of Cloud Computing</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It may happen that everyone's need and purpose for type of cloud service deployment is different from each other. For that you have to decide that what kind of accessibility you want for your company. There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: Public cloud, Private cloud, Hybrid cloud.</p><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>1. Public cloud</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It can be a free or paid on-demand computing services owned by third-party cloud service providers, in which they provide us their computers storage, servers over the internet. In this scenario multiple users can use same storage given by any organization simultaneously and also cloud service providers are responsible for all management and maintenance of the system. Some examples are Google cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services cloud.</p><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>2. Private cloud</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is also known as Internal Cloud which offers many of the services from Public cloud with self-service, scalability and elasticity. In this case the scenario is high level of security and privacy provided with inaccessibility of third party providers.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Services are only provided within the organization and select users rather than general public. One drawback is that the company is responsible for whatever the cost required to manage private cloud. Microsoft, HP Data Centre, Ubuntu are some examples of private cloud.</p><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>3. Hybrid cloud</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is a combination of both Public and Private cloud which allows you to share the data and applications in between them. It will give you more flexibility and deployment options, security, enhancement in existing architecture. Some companies that uses Hybrid cloud that are Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Cisco.</p><h2 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>Types of Cloud Services</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>This is also called as stack of services the reason behind that is they build on the top of the other. The three major types of cloud services are following:</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id14/id14.1.jpg' ><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>1. Infrastructure as a service</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>IaaS allows you to use their IT infrastructure such as Servers, Virtual machines, Networking, Storage, and other resources. You are able to access this services on the basis of pay-as-per-use model. Simply they enable users to access their pre-defined hardware configuration for specific period of time on rent. This service can be offered for each type of the cloud computing models.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let's take an example, Assume that you are a person who live in a room on rent in a house and gives money to the owner as more time as you lived. Owner of the room gives you limited things to access.</p><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>2. Platform as a service</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is a type of service which gives you environment to Deploy, Test, Deliver, Update, and manage the software applications. Application can be a web or mobile one just to make some easiness for developers. Here we don't need to worry about setting and managing up the infrastructure of server.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is consist of all services of IaaS including Development tools, Application design, testing, Database Management System, Business intelligence and many more. Examples- Azure, Google App Engine, etc.</p><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>3. Software as a service</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>SaaS allows you to connect and use applications based on cloud over the internet. Here the cloud service provider is only responsible for managing software and hardware like software upgrades and security patching with availability as well as security of your data.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Examples are Google Apps, Drop Box, Big Commerce, Slack, etc.</p>",

It is the successor of programming language that are C and C++ which back then were very popular.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>1. What is JAVA Programming Language?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Java is an object-oriented programming language that produces software multiple platforms . When a programmers write a java applications, The compiled code runs on most operating systems, including windows Mac OS. Syntax of Java from the C and C++programming languages. The format of bytecode is platform-independent. A virtual machine, called the JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE, is used to run the bytecode on each platform.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>2. Implementation of Java</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The implementation is divided into two different distributions:</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which provides the minimum requirements for executing a java application, it consist of Java Virtual Machine(JVM),core classes and supporting files.</li><li>Java Development Kit (JDK) which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the Java compiler, Javadoc, Jar, and a debugger.</li></ul><img class='img-fluid rounded ' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id16/id16.1.png' alt=''><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>3. Features of Java</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Java has multiple features. Some of these are unique to Java Object Oriented – In Java, everything is represented as objects. An object is kind of wrapper that encapsulated data and its associated behavior.Java provides support for all major object-oriented principles as seen in other object-oriented languages.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Platform Independent – A program compiled on one machine can be executed on any machine in the world without any change.It is very different to C or C++ applications where programs compiled into binaries specific to OS.</li><li>Compiled -Java compiler compiles the java source code into the bytecode. Java Virtual Machine(JVM) executes this bytecode which is executable on many operating system. </li><li>Secure – Java applications run in Java runtime environment (JRE) with almost no interaction with system OS. It makes Java more secure than other languages.</li><li>Multithreaded – Java supports writing applications which can do multiple tasks in separate threads. For example, a Java application serve a user login form while running background processes also.</li><li>OS Architecture-neutral – Java compiler generates an OS architecture-neutral class files or bytecode.</li></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>4.

Only then can it be executed.</li><li>The Java source file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with other than public access and any number of public inner classes.</li><li> When the source file contains multiple classes, make one class ‘public’ and name the source file with that public class name.</li></ul>",

In this blog we will try to cover all the concepts that are necessary for each and every starter who wants to learn C++. So not just waste the time and let’s get started…</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Importance of C++</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Most people are confused about which language we should choose Java, Python or C++, many of them prefer python since it’s easy to understand and implement because of the huge number of library. If you search it on any server engine they will also refer you to go with the python which is right away. There is more complexity to learn Java and C++ as compare to Python.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>If you see during the process of placements, companies want their candidate to wright the code in <b>C++ and Java</b> except Python. They know that it becomes easy to write any code in python that’s why if you want to be a competitive programmer you would have to go with C++ as it is a little bit faster in nature. In industries, Java is most used language but now if you think to choose java then just keep one thing in mind that whenever you enter in any company then you have to learn the language which is used by that company. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>How to Write a Simple Program in C++</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Before moving forward let’s see how a basic C++ program looks like.

Main aim of OOP’s in any programing language is to implement real examples in a program by binding data members (variables) and member functions (functions) together using classes and objects. There are four principles of OOP’s in C++ below we will explain them one by one. Following is one example of how to create class and object in C++</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id17/id17.2.jpg' alt=''><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>1. Encapsulation</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The idea of encapsulation is <b>bundling or tying</b> data and methods that operate on that data. The main purpose of encapsulation in OOP is to preventing our data which is inside the class from outsiders to directly access. It mean’s anyone can access your data but not directly. They can access encapsulated data just by taking help of some methods like <b>getters and setters</b>.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id17/id17.3.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The output of the above program will be…</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Krutika is 19 years old”</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>2.Abstraction</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In programming abstraction means displaying essential information and hiding complex or non-essential information from the user. In this concept we are going to create a class that will represent a method and that method which is able to perform addition operation will hide the complexity from user. We have two ways to implement abstraction in C++ i.e.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id17/id17.4.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let’s see how we can implement abstraction using methods from abstract class…</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id17/id17.5.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The output of the above program will be…</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Sum is 200”</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>3.Inheritance</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The concept of inheritance is same like the concept of parent-child example. A base class (sub class) can derive or access the public properties of parent class (super class) is called Inheritance. Base/child class is a class which is inhering the members of parent class and class whose members are inherited called parent class. This principle is mainly used for code reusability. There are five types of inheritance in C++</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id17/id17.6.jpg' alt=''><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id17/id17.7.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The output of the above program will be…</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Parent member value is 10”</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Child member value is 30”</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>4.Polymorphism</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The meaning of Polymorphism is “many-forms” and it occurs when we implement inheritance in our program. Suppose you have a method called Dance () in parent class and another method with same name in derived class with their own implementation then the concept of polymorphism came into the picture. By going through the above example you will be able to understand what polymorphism is.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id17/id17.8.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The output of the above program will be…</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Dancing”</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Dancing Hip-Hop”</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Access Modifier</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Access modifier is used to specify the accessible area for data members and functions of a class. You should remember one thing that everything in C++ is private by default. We have three Access Modifiers in C++: Public, Private and Protected.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>Public:</b> It can be accessible for everyone</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>Private:</b> It can be access within a class</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>Protected:</b> It can’t be access outside of its class except derived class (sub class) of that class</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Constructor</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>A constructor is a special type of function automatically called when object of that class created to initialize those objects. Constructor has same name as the class itself and It should always have to be in a public mode otherwise you will not able to access them outside a class. If we do not create any constructor, then in that case compiler generates a default constructor. Let’s see how a parameterized constructor looks like</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id17/id17.9.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>There are three types of constructors in C++</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Default</li><li>Parameterized</li><li>Copy</li></ul>",

      "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'> I am not quite sure if you have noticed, but recently we are coming across the term META quite frequently </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Yes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp all have been specifying something about META . But what is Metaverse? Why are people excited about it ? and how can it change the society that we know? </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The concept of Metaverse is quite simple! We as humans have evolved a lot….we are moving towards more and more engaging mediums. We started from a newspaper and now we spend most of our time watching TikToks and reels on Instagram, what comes next is the METAVERSE. Take it as an internet which you are not just looking at but inside of, suppose you are playing online games with your friends, shopping or meditating to smooth music, in metaverse everything would feel more real and more convincing. It is basically a LIVING – SHARED – EVERLASTING – VIRTUAL UNIVERSE. This will be achieved using a combination of Augmented reality and virtual reality and Mark Zuckerberg has a vision to make metaverse available to maximum amount of people and hence the cost of equipment’s needed for metaverse virtual environment will be substantially low. In my opinion this is something very cool but scary at the same time. Let me first take you through the positives</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>EXPIRENCES- </h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>On a same day you could be shooting zombies in a multiplayer game and go on a bike ride in Ladakh at a comfort and safety of staying at home.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>EXPRESSIONS-</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>There are some talks that metaverse will include expressions of your character which would be achieved using special devices. You now have a profile picture but in METAVERSE you would have an Avatar of your own and not just some cartoonish character a real-world looking character</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id18/id18.1.jpeg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>[Original METAVERSE character (source: Metaverse briefing)]</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>KNOWLEDGE- </h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well libraries are old fashioned right ?.who would take all the trouble when you could just google it. But googling will be just old fashioned in the METAVERSE as libraries, you could be able to feel and touch things be more interactive. You can travel anywhere in the world…. Hell ya ! you could be there when the industrial revolution took place or when Sir Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon…. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'> PRODUCTIVITY-</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well if knowledge increases so does productivity. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>ECONOMY </h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Meta is building its own store where you could purchase things for your virtual environment. To your surprise many big brands like GUCCI have actually started working for their stores in META. Most of these transactions would be done using CRYPTO-CURRENCIES in turn boost the crypto market.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well, that’s that, but METAVERSE is actually quite scary Let us take DATA ! we all know Facebooks relationship with handling user data is quite bad and that too when we were somewhat involved with the social media but just think in METAVAERSE you are completely involved….its not just your photo or your location but it is WHOLE YOU ! that is where things get pretty serious about the metaverse</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>What is REAL ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In an era of virtual reality that almost feels real we will actually forget what’s real….Lets take the Facebooks algorithm we are been shown ONLY those things that we agree on….even you must had noticed it…suppose if you don’t like Pigeons in your METAVERSE they will not be there. If you believe there is no COVID, well in your METAVERSE it will not exist.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>SECURITY-</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Suppose you (AVATAR) are in a disco with some strangers using meta as well, now you don’t really know who that person is maybe he is a criminal dancing just besides you. What if your friends account gets hacked and behind the avatar he is not your friend but some douchebag talking to you.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>Last but the most important WHAT ABOUT US ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>What happens at the end of the day? We are just as normal as we were before…. You are maybe the savior of the world in the virtual reality game, or your avatar has perfect body, cool hair, great voice but at the end of the day you are just YOU…. right? Wouldn’t that affect a person’s mental health ?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>MANY QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ANSWERED BEFORE METAVERSE GOES FULLFLEGED PUBLIC !</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Believe me it is not just Facebook, many big companies are being working on it. Facebook is just the first to take the dip in the ocean.</p>",

      "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In today's world, we are facing a lot of under-the-table corruption and due to this corruption, there is a lot of black money transactions which is stored in some or the other databases. But we don't consider these databases as reliable as there is no centralized access and the admin of these databases can change the data anytime which is immensely risky and lacks security. So we need such a decentralized system and the authority of this system is been shared by all the users. Also, any malpractices, temperance, and interference with the data can be avoided with such an advanced system or database called a BlockChain.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>What is Blockchain Technology?</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Blockchain is an underlying technology behind Bitcoin and Etherum.In simple words, Blockchain is a continuously updated record of who holds what. These records are stored in different blocks, secured using cryptography, and linked together in the form of chains and that's how it's named BlockChain. Cryptography means the records are encrypted with the help of a code that ensures security to the user. This list of records, known as the distributed ledger is decentralized and is available for everyone to see and verify. In addition, the BlockChain is tamper-free and unhackable due to its distributed nature. If any tampering or editing is tried by any of the users then the request is been rejected by other members in the distributed system and hence no changes can be made in the BlockChain.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id19/id19.1.jpg' alt=''><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>History of BlockChain</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>BlockChain was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta, two researchers who needed such a system in which the data like document timestamps cannot be hampered by anyone. But it took around two decades for the actual implementation of the idea. In 2009, an unknown developer named Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin through the implementation of BlockChain and that was when the real-world application of BlockChain came into existence. Later, the boom of BlockChain proliferated exponentially and is still ruling the world.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Most people think that BlockChain is for criminal-minded and anti-government people. But the hard truth is, BlockChain is far beyond cryptos and has numerous other applications.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id19/id19.2.jpg' alt=''><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id19/id19.3.jpg' alt=''><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>Importance of BlockChain</h3><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>1. Why prefer cryptocurrency over normal Bank Transactions?</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Normal bank transactions are more prone to frauds whereas there are no chances of frauds in cryptocurrency as the central government cannot counterfeit with the cryptocurrency as it does with normal paper currency. There are many ways by which a bank transaction can fail but there are no chances of cryptocurrency transactions to be failed. Some technical issues can occur in bank transactions during the money transfer which can even lead to loss of money. Also, there are many cases of a bank account being hacked. Alongside, the Bank account has some transfer limits and charge for high transfer charges. On the other hand, there are no such constraints on cryptocurrency transactions.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>2.BlockChain-The next stage of the Internet</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>BlockChain is even considered the next generation of the Internet by many researchers and businessmen as it holds vast potentials for business, society, and individuals.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let's understand how?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Presently, the Internet is working on the concept of copying and distributing information. For example, if you are watching a YouTube video or checking out your mail, then you are looking at the digital copy of the original. This is called double-spending. Double spending was one of the major hurdles in the development of digital currency and one day in 2008, it wasn't a problem anymore. Now people can transfer money, trade securities, buy and sell assets, using digital currency without the need of any middlemen.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id19/id19.4.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Double spending</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>3. FITS model of BlockChain application</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>FITS is an acronym for Fraud-Intermediate-Troughput-Stable data. It highly focuses on areas with a high propensity of frauds and then BlockChain helps in reducing those frauds. It can be used to eliminate middlemen where intermediaries do not provide value any more. BlockChain needs stable data as it needs to stay in the chain for a long period.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id19/id19.5.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>FITS Model</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>4. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations(DAOs)</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Internet is emerging as a new technological era as web2.0 due to the advancement of BlockChain technologies leading to technological, economic, and social innovations such as digital currencies, distributed ledger's BlockChain IoT systems that will remodel industries from finance to insurance and energy to cybersecurity.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>5. Tokenization</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Tokenization is the process by which a physical or virtual asset or commodity can be digitally represented. In simple words, If you have a digital token or value that represents 1/1000 the value of your home and that 1000 tokens equal the entire value of your home and you have a token that represents a piece of that physical asset that you own.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>6. How do security and Transparency both go hand in hand?</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>As the record is stored in the encrypted form no one can access the data and make changes to it. As the BlockChain technology works on the decentralized method, the information is transparent to all the participants and if there is any discrepancy or anyone is trying to reach out to the data, permission is asked to all the existing participants and if the permission is approved by all the participants then the data is accessible and if the request is rejected then no access is available.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>7.BlockChain is cost-effective than the traditional economic models</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>BlockChain involves no third-party individual or middlemen to perform duties like digital payments, for insurance claims, for asset management, for the stock exchange, for land registry, and many more, and the transactions occur directly from one individual to another by reducing the cost and commission of the middleman.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>8. Prevention of data leak and hacking</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>There have been many cases in the past that have broken the trust of people from companies. But in cryptocurrency, there are fewer possibilities of data hacks and leaks.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>9.BlockChain and IoT</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Blockchain is considered to be an encrypted, distributed, decentralized system created to facilitate tamper-proof, real-time records. IoT is used to describe the interconnection of computing devices embedded in day-to-day objects through the Internet that helps them to send and receive data. When you merge these two technologies, you create a model for a reliable, secure, and permanent method of recording data. Blockchain makes IoT devices more powerful by enhancing their security and transparency in the IoT ecosystems.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id19/id19.6.jpg' alt=''><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>10. Digital Footprint</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The footprints of all the digital assets can be traced back to the beginning ranging from the banking industry to the HealthCare sector. In healthcare, it helps to trace the medical conditions of patients over a while. In the banking industry, it will help to understand the transactional behavior and financial ability of a person to decide on giving a loan or services, etc.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>I hope you will gain a clear insight about BlockChain through this Blog.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Thanks for reading!!</p>",

      "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In the 21st century, the world is evolving at a fast pace. Things are changing so quickly that sometimes we don't even understand what just happened? The skills which are relevant today don't even exist the next day. Gen-Z is actively involved in technology, cyberspace, innovations, and experiments. This virtual world has led us to multiple good destinations for a better and bright future, but it also has negative perks that no one can avoid. Each of us is experiencing the negative side of these good happenings in our day-to-day life as we are available virtually everywhere, so our life is! But while being everywhere practically, we have to keep in mind that <b>'We have to take preventive measures to have a safe and peaceful virtual life.'</b></p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>I use multiple electronic devices to walk with the generation of technology that humankind is using; I take conscious precautions to avoid certain things. So, these are the easy but crucial preventive measures I take for my safety to prevent cybercrime and to experience safe cyberspace:</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>1. Don't share your personal information online:</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>We readily share our personal information online with strangers while talking to them. We share information like where we live, how many members we have in our family, where we study, what our parents do, their income, and so many such things! We tend to share our private data with strangers we never saw in reality. It's crucial to be conscious while sharing anything personal with anyone. People who have our personal information try to harass us online, so be aware of what you share with others on different social media platforms.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>2. Always keep strong passwords and never share them, even with your closed ones:</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Cybercrimes are at their peak. When hacking someone else’s account, strong passwords of more than eight characters of different types of keys keep our account safe and not easily accessible to any illegal hacker. And sometimes, we readily share our passwords with our closed ones, which is not good. We never know how someone can use our personal information for doing something fraudulent!</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>3. Never use public WiFi while accessing personal or financial data:</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>While traveling, we often use public WiFi to access our personal or financial data; this also leads to hacking our phones and using our personal and financial information illegally. Rather than using public WiFi, use VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection. It secures your device information and does not share them with other sites or apps.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>4. Turn off the services you don't need:</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>We use Google Maps while traveling, but we forget to turn off the GPS (Global Positioning System) when it is of no use. Google Maps or any other location-tracking app keeps tracking our location and saves the data, which someone can use for creating a mishap for us. So the right thing is to turn it off when it is of no use.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>5. Be careful of what you are downloading on your device:</h3> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>We download various documents from different sites which are not even protected. The sites use malware, and when we download the files from there, the malware automatically comes to our system, which damages our system and sometimes tracks our storage and shares it with a third party that is illegal and uncons titutional. For example, the Tik Tok app, which the Government of India banned, was used to track user's information and share the user's private information with a third party. The specifics of information sharing were given in ‘terms of use’ confusingly but revealed later.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>6. Practice safe browsing:</h3> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Some apps have different functions but still ask to access and manage our phone logs, gallery photos, messages, etc. It is significant to be aware of such permissions. Even some websites use cookies for functioning, and when we open that website, a pop-up message asks us to accept those cookies. Only accept cookies if that website’s IP (Internet Protocol) address shows a lock symbol. Always practice safe and secure browsing.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>7. Always have an Antivirus on your device and keep them updated:</h3> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Antivirus software protects our device from harmful viruses and malware. When we keep them up-to-date, they scan our machine and notify us immediately if any virus or malware is present in our system or damaging our data. Always have antivirus updates on your phone, which you can use for your device’s safety.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>These are some of the practices I follow while browsing the internet. I hope you will follow them too. Have a happy and safe cyberspace:)</h3>",

One such byproduct of humans being expressive is Technology, which has proven to be a means to bring visions to materiality. Furthermore the amalgamation of technology and creativity brought science fiction. Since the 19th-century science fiction is seen as a prototype of the future. Many sci-fi concepts like 3D printers, artificial intelligence etc. have made it to our world. Lately, one theory in particular has got the entire world googling.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In April 2020, two well known personalities from the music industry - Travis Scott and Marshmello had their concert inside a video game, fortnite participated by 10.7 million people. Politicians were also seen going virtual in 2020, the Biden Harris campaign launched a map in fortnite. The news that really exposed us all to a famed concept was On 28th October, 2021 when headlines read as, “Facebook has rebranded itself as Meta”. A concept “beyond the universe”. Metaverse, a successor to the Internet, was first seen in Snow Crash - a science fiction novel written by Neal Stephenson. It is estimated that the metaverse will be built in 10 years. It is believed to completely change the way we are networking today.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Metaverse in a lay man’s terms can be described as a take on a three-dimensional world. A virtual space where every individual will be represented by their respective avatars and can be together with their geographically distant friends, play games, teleport, socialize, buy and sell land, work, invest and what not. For instance, imagine attending your favourite band’s concert with a pal who is miles away from you in just a few steps. Major technologies used for metaverse are virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. Basically, if one has played video games, one is fairly familiar with this. Point to be noted here is that metaverse does not exist as of yet.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Companies from Microsoft to Nvidia are diving deeper into this every second. The metaverse market which was worth 46 billion dollars in 2020 is estimated to reach 800 billion dollars by the year 2024. Talking about Facebook, it has created 10,000 jobs and itself invested 10 billion dollars on metaverse. Epic games and roblox are seen leading this race of creating realistic virtual realms. Upcoming video games that are bent more towards virtual three-dimensional worlds are set to reach greater engagements and growth.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>While metaverse is at a very nascent stage, there is lots of potential just in the idea of it. Just like any other technology having both benefits and concerns, metaverse will have it too. This is just a small strive towards giving a new structure to our society. A good deal of challenges are yet to be faced. For the present, let’s come together and embrace this journey of beholding Neal Stephenson’s inventiveness slowly but surely come alive.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Science fiction is not quirky anymore, we live in a futuristic world now” - Bonnie Hammer.</p>",

      "blogContent": "<h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Wanna know about C programming??</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Then this blog is for you!!</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5 '>What is C programming?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The C programming is a computer programming language that was developed to do system programming for the operating system. It is an imperative programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in year 1972. It is a compiled language. It is popular language because it is easy to use, memory convenient and simple to use, so many programmers decide to learn C language before Python or Java. It also offers many features and functionalities to the programmers. Many programmers still use the C language to develop various applications, games, etc.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Features of C Programming:</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It provides many features they are as follows:</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Fast and Effective: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>As C is compiler-based programming language it compiles and executes faster than Java or Python because they are interpreted programming language.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Procedural Language: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>People can write their programs as a series of step-by-step instructions.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Memory Management: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It has the feature of dynamic memory allocation, which can free the allocate memory at any time by calling free() function.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Case sensitive: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>C programming language is case sensitive. If we declare two variables such as “X” and “x” as an integer then the C language treats these two variables differently.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Structured Programming: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In C, you can divide the program into small blocks of code as function. Function is used for code reusability.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'> Middle Level Language: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>C is middle level language as it has capabilities of assembly language and it also has features of high-level language.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'> Rich Library: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>C programming language has a rich library which offers useful inbuilt functions that makes the development fast.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Recursion: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In C, we can define a function inside function which is called recursion which helps in code reusability.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Pointer:</li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is one of the most useful feature in C. We can directly interact with the memory by using pointers. We can also use pointers in structures, arrays, function, etc.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>General Purpose Language: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>C language is used in various domains like from system programming to photo editing softwares. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5 '>Syntax of C language:</h2><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <ol>#include stido.h></ol> <ol>int main(){</ol> <ol>printf(“Hello World!!”);</ol> <ol>return 0;</ol> <ol>}</ol></ul><h2>Here,</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>#includestdio.h> gets the standard input/output tools ready for program to use. This also allows the text to be displayed(output).</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>int main () is called the main function, and the code starts to run from here in a C program.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>printf(“Hello World!!”); is what displays text. </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>return 0; this tells the computer that the program has finished.</p>",

You need a cohesive design, an understandable user experience, well-structured HTML, memorable class names and well organized style sheets. Now all of this is going to take time and can be very tedious and there are a lot of ways that it can go wrong and a poor user interface can lead to poor user adoption. Now there's a solution to all of this, a CSS framework, a library of pre-built UI components with web standards and best practices built right in.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>But if you are looking to save time and energy not all CSS frameworks are going to be created equally, some are going to be less well documented and take a longer time to learn and be tougher to use. Fortunately there's Bulma, the CSS framework that's simple to learn and simple to use.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>What is Bulma?</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>If you're familiar with something like Bootstrap or Foundation then Bulma is along the same lines as those in the sense that it allows you to easily create pages using a bunch of different components and it gives you a way of organizing those components on the page.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Getting started with Bulma</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Visit <a href='https://bulma.io/'>https://bulma.io/</a> go to the documentation here and go to the getting started part.

How does it work? Now, all of your questions can be answered by a single term called AIML</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Have you ever heard about <b>AIML(Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning)</b>? Well basically AIML is all about taking machines and trying to make them act in a human way. We code them in a way where machines like Doraemon learn new things by making different decisions. AI helps computers to analyze their problems and solve them.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>GenZ like us loves to play computer games and Gameplay is one of the many zones where AI is used. We get emails everyday, some of them are useful while some are spam. Here our spam detection sorts the spam mails in a different folder. Also we get recommendations of videos in YouTube or Netflix based on our preference or the stuff we have previously watched. These are all the provisions we enjoy in our day-to- day life thanks to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>There is a term called Reinforcement Learning in AIML. Here machines are sanctioned to learn from mistakes or experiences they make while problem solving so that they can find the best possible method to solve the particular problem. We make them to <b>EXPLOIT</b> and <b>EXPLORE</b>, to gain many new things by taking risks sometimes.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>AIML is a key which unlocks the door of solutions to many global or local problems. In near future, machines can be a helping hand to humans. In conclusion AIML is a tech field to help humans with problem solving or decision making.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let me know, how interesting you found AIML to be? And can a machine flip pancake for you, what do you think???</p>",

Our world is transforming every single penny into digital binaries, better known as Cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency, using Blockchain technology, is revolutionizing transactions across boundaries by eliminating banking!</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Blockchain is a technology that enables moving digital coins or assets from one individual to another. In short, Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, open public ledger. Open ledger means chain of transactions, so Blockchain is open and public to its network! Everyone on the network can see, validate and transact, making it a safe driver.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>A cryptocurrency is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrency is digital and is typically not issued by a central authority. There are different types of cryptocurrencies available across the globe. Some popular cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Bytecoin, etc. Bitcoin is currently the king of cryptocurrencies.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Bitcoin is money that is digital. These are digital coins that one can send via internet. Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 developed Bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation. As part of the implementation, Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database. Till date, Satoshi Nakamoto is considered to be anonymous. </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Bitcoin mining is the process of verifying Bitcoin transactions and recording them onto the public ledger. In Blockchain, the transactions are verified by Bitcoin users. Most important fact here is that “Bitcoin is not Blockchain!”</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The concept of single universal ledger with multiple nodes including the banks, insurance, regulators, etc. is the heart of the Blockchain. There is no need of individual authentications from different participant nodes, thus reducing the friction and making the system time efficient. </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Whenever a transaction or a set of transactions happen, it gets added to a block of transaction in a chain of already existing transactions, altogether forming a chain of blocks authenticated by everyone, known as the Blockchain. This Blockchain is protected by the most effective cryptography algorithms present today, so it is difficult to hack. Every block added is immutably linked to the previous block, so changing just one block is not valid as the whole chain needs to be changed by the hacker, which is practically not possible. So, Blockchain is supremely secure. As it is a chain, backtracking is possible.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Frauds can be eliminated or minimized by means of Blockchain. Banks, hotels, agriculture, etc. sectors are implementing Blockchain. A developer responsible for developing and optimizing blockchain protocols, crafting the architecture of blockchain systems, developing smart contracts and web apps using Blockchain technology are commonly called Blockchain developers. Many fortune 500 companies and top MNCs like IBM, Microsoft, Accenture, Capgemini, etc. are on the hunt for skilled blockchain developers.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Flexibility, transparency, reduced transaction cost, efficiency, auditability, traceability, security, worldwide adoption, distributed architecture, open public ledger, decentralization, security and faster transaction settlements are primary features of Blockchain. As everything as a flip side, even Blockchain has some disadvantages like high maintenance costs, data immutability, irreversibility, challenging scalability, high energy consumption, network dependencies, immaturity, self-maintenance and interoperability</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Financial literacy is the possession of the set of skills and knowledge that allows an individual to make informed and effective decisions with all of their financial resources. Cryptocurrency is an internet-based medium of exchange which uses cryptographical functions to conduct financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies leverage Blockchain technology to gain decentralization, transparency, and immutability. Bitcoin is most popular cryptocurrency in today’s world and Blockchain is future.</p>",

      "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Recently, the entire world was thrown into a tizzy with the discovery of a major cybersecurity bug- Log4Shell. It affected millions of applications worldwide and most major softwares declared that they were susceptible to it.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>What is log4j?</h2> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Log4j is an open-source logging service provided by Apache; used by almost every other software and program. It is a Java program that allows a software to log every activity in their server. These logs are often useful to discover bugs and monitor software.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>The vulnerability</h2> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>On 9 December 2021, the CVE-2021-44832 was reported with a vulnerability severity score of 10/10. This vulnerability basically allows remote unauthorized personnel to execute code on a server using Log4j versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0. As you can imagine, it is a critical flaw and was termed as “Log4Shell”, reflecting its behavior.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The culprit is a feature of Log4j which allows the logging function to fetch data through variables in the string before writing it down as the log record. The function doesn’t check if the data that is fetched is from an authorized source and allows malicious entities to inject code in this way. This feature had been slated for deprecation and was only there due to the need for backward compatibility.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>First discovery</h2> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>One the of earliest remote code execution (RCE) attacks due to this flaw were witnessed in the Java version of Minecraft, a Microsoft-owned game. It is reported that attackers had started exploiting this vulnerability almost a week before it was assigned a CVE and alarm bells were sounded worldwide.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Corrective measures</h2> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>A security patch was immediately released with Log4j 2.17.0 and national security centers urged companies to quickly update to the latest release; some even threatening legal repercussions otherwise. A public notice for mitigation was also issued within hours to reduce the fallout.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In the next few days, a number of other vulnerabilities were found of lower severities and patched in the subsequent Log4j 2.17.x releases. Users were advised to update all softwares as soon as they released their own security patches; citing the ubiquitous nature of Log4j. The latest safe versions are Log4j 2.3.2 (for Java 6), 2.12.4 (for Java 7), and 2.17.1 (for Java 8 and later).</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>The blame game</h2> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>This critical incident threw light on the plight of open-source software. As the flaw was discovered, it was also found that the Log4j library was poorly maintained due to the lack of resources and was largely a hobby project. This brought to light the lack of support for open-source projects with large user bases. It also raised the moral issue of big tech companies using open-source software in their premium products without providing them with any support.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Present situation and future plans</h2> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The fallout from Log4shell continues almost a month after the incident as security firms report that there hasn’t been a significant reduction in attacks yet (as of January 2022). There are fears of dormant code attacks because of the highly publicized and quick fix of this vulnerability. Specialists fear that attackers did not have time to craft active execution attacks so they installed dormant code into the victim servers which will be used to create malicious attacks later on.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The US government has taken note of the critical nature of these cyber security threats and has convened a meeting with experts to figure out a way to prevent such incidents in the future. The government has expressed commitment to improving open-source security with the help of all major tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, and IBM.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Log4shell is a well-timed wake-up call to the industry as more and more critical functions are performed with software where flaws like these can prove fatal.</p>",

      "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The computers were made to make the human task in an easier way. In today’s date, due to computer technology it’s so easy to do things by eradicating the word ‘impossible’ for doing tasks. This dream future of many people who wished for the development of humanity had been successful in today’s world. No doubt this was possible with the help of the computers.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The basic unit that makes possible for computer to do the task is Programming Language. To make the computer perform in a particular behavior is achieved with the help of Programming Language. These languages have long history, since 1842.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>The beginning of journey from year 1842:</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The well-known Charles Babbage, the father of computer, had made the device but was confused about how to give instructions to the programming language. Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician wrote detailed instructions for the analytical engine. It made her realize the computer could follow a series of simple instructions to perform the complex operations.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Assembly Languages(1949):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>This is a low-level language, which means it can directly interact to the computer. The instructions given would be understandable to the machines. It is still in use for simulation flight navigation systems or also used to create computer viruses.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Autocode(1952):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Autocode was first developed by Alick Glennie. This was the first compiled language, i.e the language would be translated to machine code with the help of compilers. This language was used on the early computing machines such as Ferranti Pegasus and Sirius.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>FORTRAN(1957):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>FORTRAN was developed by John Backus and IBM. The word FORTRAN is derived from term Formula Translation, as the machine was developed to calculate the complex-level scientific, mathematical and statistical calculations.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>ALGOL(1958):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>ALGOL derived from term Algorithmic Language, was developed together by American and European computer scientists. It’s the start phase of the popular programming languages as C, C++, Java and Pascal. It was the first language that introduced implementation of nested function and to have the code blocks like “begin” and “end” to start and end the code respectively. It has simple syntax than of FORTRANS.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>COBOL(1959):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Common Business Oriented Language, namely COBOL, is that programming language behind many mastercard processors, ATMs, telephone and cell calls, hospital signals, and traffic signals systems. Dr. Grace Murray developed it with an intension of creating the language as to be run on any computer irrespective of any type or brand. COBOL is still used in present day for gaming systems and banking.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>BASIC(1964):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code abbreviated as BASIC, was developed by student’s group at Dartmouth College. The main purpose of this language was for the students who are weak in understanding the computer or mathematics. The language was further developed by Bill Gates and Paul Allen for their newly-formed company Microsoft.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>C(1972):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>C was developed with Unix Operating System by Dennis Ritchie. This procedural Language became so popular due to its hardware interaction and flexibility, that many languages had been derived from C like C#, D, Go, JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python, Perl, etc. Hence, C is called as the Mother of all the Languages.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>SQL(1972):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>SQL, which was previously known as SEQUEL, was developed to communicate with relational databases. At present, the Abbreviation ‘SQL’ stands for ‘Structures Query Language’. The main purpose of SQL was to add, delete, update and access the data in efficient, systematic and secured form.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>C++(1983):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>C++ is the extension of C language, which introduces Object-Oriented Programming concept. Since 1886 it has been marked as one of the top 10 language. It is mainly used in Adobe Photoshop, Game engines, MS Office and some other high-performance software. It has the features like abstraction, encapsulation, etc. that has also been implemented by modern languages.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Perl(1987):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Perl is general purpose, high-level language developed by Larry Wall. It was initially designed as scripting language designed for text editing, but now it’s widely used for CGI, network programming, database applications, etc.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Python(1991):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Python is a high-level programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum. It is the language which is object-oriented as well as procedure-oriented. It is one of the most popular programming languages at present and is used for developing AI, operating systems, mobile apps, video games and for many more purposes.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Java(1995):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Java is considered as faster and more efficient than Python as it is a compiled language. It was developed by James Gosling for interactive TV projects but at present it is found every from computers to mobile phones. It is also used for server-side language for many back-end development projects.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>PHP(1995):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>PHP known as ‘Hypertext Preprocessor’ was developed by Rasmus Lerdorf. It is a Server-side Scripting Language embedded in HTML. Many websites still use PHP for their server-side scripting. It can build entire e-commerce sites and can manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Groovy(2003):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Groovy was derived from Java and was developed by James Strachan and Bob McWhirter. It provides flexibility and add on more enhanced feature to the applications. It has syntax similar to Java, but is more easy to read like in Python.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Swift(2014):</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Swift was developed by Apple to replace the programming languages like C, C++. The main motive behind its development was to make the easier understandable code that can make the computation would have less chances of generating error. ‘Duolingo’ had launched its new app that was made in swift.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>This was the overall evolution and history of programming languages. Some old programming languages like COBOL and FORTRANS are still in use by the IT professionals presently. SQL, Java, Python are the programming languages that have the vast future that could help to develop the new technology. This is not the end as the programming languages would still be developing, as it has done around since past 150 years and the coming future to it will make everyone see the magic any human being would make.</p>",

      "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Cyber security is the process of identifying and mitigating the risks posed by digital systems vulnerabilities and threats. The term 'cyber' is a slang term for a computer that is connected to the internet or any other device that has a processor, input/output, and networking connections. Viruses, worms, Trojans, and malware are all common threats. The use of cyber tools in warfare to achieve objectives that would not be possible using physical means such as bombs or missiles is referred to as cyber warfare. Cyber security has always been a concern, but it became more prominent after major events such as the 2015 Bangladesh bank robbery, in which hackers stole $81 million from the bank's central account at its Bangladesh headquarters. Cyber security professionals are responsible for safeguarding critical systems and data. Cyber security's main goal is to prevent hackers from gaining access to information or engaging in nefarious activities that put Users information at risk.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id31/id31.1.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Cyber security is important to prevent government, military, law enforcement, and private industry from Cyber Attacks. Software is used by government agencies to manage the US budget system, and the military uses it to track troop movement. Cyber Attacks could cripple important services or even destroy the country's financial security as a result of these critical uses.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Companies must implement cyber security protections in order to operate securely in today's technological world. Firewalls, anti-virus Programs, encryption codes that prevent hackers from easily accessing sensitive data, and data backup systems.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id31/id31.2.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Businesses, governments, and individuals are increasingly concerned about cyber security. Despite the numerous controls and systems in place, cyber-attacks continue to occur. The Target data breach, the Heart bleed bug, and the WannaCry attack are just a few of the most recent high-profile attacks. These incidents exposed personal information of customers, which could be used by hackers for identity theft or as part of a fraudulent scheme.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id31/id31.3.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Cyber security is an area of study and research that is constantly expanding. Cyber security in cyberspace is the subject of some of the most recent research. The goal of this paper is to see if a previous study from 2012 correctly identified computers within an organization and their movement across the network. The researchers were looking for two main findings: 1) how computers move across networks (e.g., LAN, WAN, etc.) and 2) how computers might behave in a network. The assumption is that computers in an organization move between locations (for example, a building or branch offices) and may change locations. A computer's behavior can also be observed.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Many networks have become globalized in recent years, with the internet serving as the primary means of communication with people and businesses all over the world. According to a new report from Gartner Inc., the number of organization’s using geographic information systems (GIS) for cyber security has increased dramatically to two-thirds. Other technologies, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewalls, and antivirus software, are used by the remaining third.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id31/id31.4.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>There is no such thing as a perfect information security agency. Most information security professionals today agree that no organization can completely protect itself from all threats. The best agencies, on the other hand, should have a variety of defense techniques that can be combined to form an effective strategy for protecting the organization from malicious activities.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>One of these techniques that could be effective in terms of cyber security and computer network defense is server hardening. This procedure is used to improve a system's security. In today's digital world, preventing harm from malicious hacking or other types of attacks can be difficult. As a result, security professionals should follow best practices and adhere to industry standards when it comes to cyber-hardening their systems.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Server hardening is one of the most important ways to protect against attacks that could harm an organization's data, infrastructure, and business strategies. Server hardening, also known as application whitelisting, employs a variety of techniques to add controls to the operating system (OS) that are unrelated to the server's installed applications. It's critical to emphasize that server hardening is a process that focuses on assets. It's not just a set of instructions to be followed blindly. It necessitates the information security expert determining the required baseline configuration and fine-tuning it based on data gathered during asset review or from other sources.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id31/id31.5.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Cybercrime and the need to protect systems from attacks are both on the rise in today's world. The government and private sector are both concerned about cyber security. Hackers are becoming more adept at exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, and hardware as technology advances. Attackers have no qualms about exploiting these flaws and exploiting them to their advantage. Depending on how the attacker uses it, a cyber-attack can be interpreted as an offence or a defense. During peacetime, an attacker may use a cyber-attack offensively to disrupt services, or defensively to prepare for an offensive attack during wartime.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id31/id31.6.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Cyber criminals are increasingly targeting children. Cybercriminals target children with malicious links or attachments through legitimate-looking email accounts and social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram in an attempt to gain access to their network. These criminals may also use the same account to send personal messages to the child, resulting in a breach of trust. After establishing his legitimacy, the attacker may request the child's home address, birthday, and other personal information. This is done so that they can send a birthday gift (which is malware) and/or other gifts that will increase trust (this may be delivered via snail mail).</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Today, everyone has the opportunity to benefit from technological advancements. This is beneficial to people, but it also exposes organization’s to new risks that cybercriminals may exploit. Because the majority of the population uses computer technology in their daily lives, either directly or indirectly.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id31/id31.7.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Depending on your level of experience and area of expertise, cyber security offers a variety of career paths. Depending on your area of interest and experience, you could work as an analyst/engineer, network administrator, programmer, or data analyst, among many other jobs. Some jobs are required, while others are optional as long as they are related to your security field, such as computer science or finance. If you're looking for a high-paying job, cyber security is the way to go because it's still relatively new and will only grow in the future.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Cyber security is an important topic that needs to be considered and researched further, and it is rapidly evolving.</p>",

But in OOP program works in another way around the program.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The key principle in OOP is “data controlling access to code”</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id33/id33.1.jpg' alt=''><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Features Of OOP</h2><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li><b>Classes and object</b></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>An class is a template, which is set of data members and member functions. In other words class is a blue print for which an individual object is created.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>An object is defined in many ways, an object is copy of class or an object is an instance entity, or ab object is set of instances, or an object is an instance of class that contains real values instead of variables.</p><li><b>Abstraction</b></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Abstraction is a process of identifying the relevant qualities and behaviours of object. It is simple and easy to use in perception of the user who is using your object. It involves identifying the significant behaviour of an object and removing complexity. </p><li><b>Encapsulation</b></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Encapsulation is a process of binding the data together-for protecting data from unwanted access-in a object where it is only accessible through that object’s interface.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Many people refer encapsulation as information hiding but both are different. In fact, information hiding is actually the result of Encapsulation.</p><li><b>Inheritance</b></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Inheritance is the ability to define a new class or object that inherits the behaviour and functionality of other existing classes.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The new class or object is called child or subclass, the original class is called parent or base class.</p><li><b>Polymorphism</b></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Polymorphism means different forms at different places. In OOP, it is language’s ability to handle objects differently, based on their type and use. Polymorphism can also be described as “one form, multiple implementations”</p></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Two types of Polymorphism</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>1. Compile time Polymorphism</b></p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is the binding that happens at the time of compiling a program. For example, while compiling a program, compiler creates a connection from calling statements to definition of the function.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The connection remains static for all time you run that program. Hence it is static binding.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>2. Run time Polymorphism</b></p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is binding which happens at the time of execution of a program. For example, execution of if-else is not predictable. Execution of if or else block totally depends on input values and correctness of condition.

And it&rsquo;s going to be your first step to choose one of them to start your coding journey! Isn&rsquo;t it exciting? It may be confusing at first if you don&rsquo;t know how to choose one… </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The basic concept of all programming languages is the same what makes them different is their syntax.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let me help you by showing an example:</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-2 mt-3'>Python:</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>print(&ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo;)</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-2 mt-3'>Java: </h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>system.out.println(&ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo;)</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The above codes look different from each other because of the difference in the syntax. But both the code will print the same output &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>So, where do we start?</h2><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id37/id37.1.png' alt=''><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Tip 1: Choosing Your first programming language.</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>When it comes to choose your first programming language, according to my opinion you have 2 main ways.</p><ol> <li class='fs-5 mb-4'>You can start by learning relatively easy language, with a simple syntax, and then progress towards other languages.</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>You can start learning a language that aligns more with your end goals.</li></ol><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>If you want to ease yourself in, and you are okay with some time before moving towards your goals, then start with a simpler language.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>This is perfectly fine and to be honest you&rsquo;re going to learn many languages throughout your programming journey.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>However, if you have a very focused goal and learning a certain language will help you achieve it. Then surely you can start with learning that language.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Tip 2: Understanding the coding fundamentals.</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>When you learn how to code, you&rsquo;ll come across various fundamentals. For instance lists, if/else statements, for loops, data types, etc.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'> So in order to learn your desired language you need to know about all the fundamentals associated with it. You can find those by simply searching on internet, practice them all into your code and learning the basics of the same.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Remember, all the programming languages are only differ by their structures and syntax. The concepts and fundamentals behind them are almost the same. So learning your next programming language would become easy if your programming fundamentals are clear, won&rsquo;t it?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>If you take one thing away from this article, let it be this: <b>focus more on learning programming fundamentals.</b></p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Tip 3: Strive for understanding, not perfection.</h2><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id37/id37.2.png' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Most of the people try to write the cleanest, shortest and the most effective code while they are learning a programming language. But this is where they fall into the trap. At this point of time, one&rsquo;s goal should be understanding the code, practice it and making the mistakes.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Yes, you heard right! making mistakes, getting numerous errors are a part of your programming journey. You should try to solve the errors more than focusing on writing a clean code.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Though writing a most effective, cleanest, and shortest code is a fantastic long-term goal that everyone should aspire to. But it&rsquo;s not something worth focusing on when you&rsquo;re already in a phase of learning a language.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Tip 4: Be patient.</h2><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id37/id37.3.png' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Programming is one of the most valuable skills you can build. If you&rsquo;re searching for “how to learn programming” it might be because you want to advance your career.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Coding requires you to approach the problems you haven&rsquo;t before. Problems that might seem easy at first might end up being far more complex to implement than you expected.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Many people try to learn a new language but quit somewhere because they get stuck at some errors and can&rsquo;t find solution. You&rsquo;ll quickly learn that computers are nit-picky, and will only do exactly what you tell them.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Tiny typos like a missing semicolon or incorrect operator can break your entire program. But Do yourself a favour and progress slowly and steadily.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Tip 5: A great technique to learn anything which is new to you.</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Learn about the thing &#8594; Know how to learn the thing &#8594; Do the thing</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>I personally use this to learn something which is new for me. If you follow the steps mentioned in the above technique then you can learn anything new you come across. </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The same will work with programming languages. Let say you want to learn a new programming language. So firstly you need to know about it, what is the particular language you&rsquo;ve chosen is being used for, how it works, etc. Now you need to search about how the language should be learnt? Best resources to learn that language, knowing how actually the programmers who have already mastered the language learnt it, etc. And finally after getting your research done you can start learning. This way you can master any programming language with a steady and good progress.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>So, this was all from my side, I hope it helps!</p>",

All these and more, requires android developers and android applications, who and which can tackle problems and provide solutions.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Wouldn&#39;t it be a moment of pride, if you are using an app created by yourself? How amazing will it get if you get the power to bring your ideas, your vision into reality using Android Development.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>What do we need to Begin? (Prerequisites)</h2><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/Android-Dev/id38/id38.1.png'><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The journey of Android Development starts with learning programming languages. We either use <em>Java or Kotlin</em> in the backend part of the app, while we use <em>XML</em> to design our app. So, it becomes necessary that you must learn coding in either <em>Java or Kotlin</em>, and <em>XML</em> language.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>With that being said, it&#39;s not necessary that you master the languages because that is almost impossible to do! A basic idea about the syntax and functions is all that we need to start!</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The IDE is the main component of Android Development. <b>Android Studio</b> is the official <em><b>I</b>ntegrated <b>D</b>evelopment <b>E</b>nvironment (IDE)</em> for Android Development. It is built on JetBrains&#39; IDEA software. And doesn&#39;t matter, whether you are using Windows, MacOS, or Linux, it is available for all these platforms. </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>And yes, the <em>Android Studio</em> is really intimidating. Like there are so many features and tools and menus and what not! But believe me, once we get handy with them, it&#39;s all good. <em>Just keep your dedication going!</em></p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>System Requirements!</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>I swear to God my RAM and my CPU might be screaming the hell out of them! Like in the initial stages of the IDE software, I could literally feel my room getting all heated up. So yeah 8 GB RAM, and a Good CPU processor is must to run it.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Following are some recommended specifications for Android Studio, and I personally wouldn&#39;t recommend any lower specifications than these, unless you want your fire alarm to set in! And if you have more budget, just spend it without any hesitation. Because it&#39;s all worth it.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>(Recommended requirements) </h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><em>Windows</em></p><ul> <li class='fs-5 mb-4'>OS: Windows 10 64-bit</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 3.0 GHz or better</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>Memory: 8/16 GB RAM</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>Free storage: 30 GB (SSD is strongly recommended)</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>Screen resolution: 1920 x 108 </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><em>MacOS</em></p><ul> <li class='fs-5 mb-4'>OS: macOS 10.15 (Catalina)</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 3.0 GHz or better</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>Memory: 8 GB RAM</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>Free storage: 4 GB (SSD is strongly recommended)</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>Screen resolution: 1920 x 1080</li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><em>Linux</em></p><ul> <li class='fs-5 mb-4'>OS: Any 64-bit Linux distribution that supports Gnome, KDE, or Unity DE</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 or better</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>Memory: 8 GB</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>Free storage: 20 GB SSD</li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>Free resolution: 1920 x 1080 </li><li class='fs-5 mb-4'>GNU C Library (glibc) 2.19 or later</li></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>WHERE SHALL WE BEGIN?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>I am just the same as you guys.

      "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Natural Language Processing is majorly a branch of computer science, specifically under the domain of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to allow computers to process and understand human language (text or voice data) and also give the response in the same textual or voice format.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>NLP is a combination of computational linguistic models, rule-based modelling, statistical modelling, machine learning, and deep learning models. Due to this model, the system is not only able to understand the language but also depict the intent or sentiment with which the sentence is outspoken or written.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>NLP is a part of our day-to-day life right from using voice-operated navigation and GPS systems using digital voice assistants like Alexa and SIRI. It also plays an integral role in tasks like language translations to text summarization. But the astonishing use case of NLP is at the enterprise level as it helps companies with business solutions gauging streamlining business operations, increasing the productivity of employees and increasing sales, and also lending better customer service.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Some tools and libraries for Natural Language processing</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is the heart of NLP as most of the approaches to Natural Language processing are using this library. NLTK is a standard python library consisting of the number of libraries and algorithms used in Computational Linguistics. This library plays a crucial role in performing the sub-processes in NLP including sentence detection, sentence parsing, word segmentation, stemming, tokenization, stop word removal, Semantic Reasoning, and lemmatization listed below.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Installation of NLTK in Google Collaboratory</h4><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id39/id39.1.png'><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Some of the Data Processing techniques in NLP</h2><ol> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>1.

Stop Word Removal</b></p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Stop words are the most common and repetitive words(eg. Is, are, or, the, this, they, them, too, etc) in the language which have no significance in interpreting the meaning of the text. These stop words create noise and it's better to remove these words for proper model implementation.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/General/id39/id39.5.png'> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>4.

They are considered the drudger in this era of so called &ldquo;big data&rdquo;. It is a class of methods for automatically creating models from data. Machine Learning is often, incorrectly, interchanged with Artificial Intelligence, but Machine Learning is actually a sub field/type of Artificial Intelligence.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>As we know that Machine learning provides the system with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience rather than explicit programming. Almost everything coming out of the technology world these days seems to have an element of artificial intelligence or machine learning in it. Machine learning today is the implementation of human abilities but not the entire potential of human intelligence.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Many of us already know somewhat about &ldquo;Machine Learning Algorithms&rdquo;. But do you know how it works and how can we program them using coding?</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>WHAT ARE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS?</h2><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/AI-ML/id40/id40.1.png' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Machine learning algorithms are the engines of machine learning, means it is the algorithms that turn a data set into a model.

There are only a few main learning styles or learning models that an algorithm can have and we will go through them in this post.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>There are three learning styles in machine learning algorithms:</h3><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>1. Supervised Learning.</h3><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/AI-ML/id40/id40.2.png' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>The input data is known as training data and has a known label or result.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Supervised learning uses training set to teach models to produce desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the machine to learn over the time. Basically supervised learning is when we train the machine using well labelled data set. Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided with a new set of data so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data and provides the desired result from labelled data.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/AI-ML/id40/id40.3.png' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>For instance, suppose we have a basket filled with some fruits. Now the first step is to train the machine with all kind of fruits one by one.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-5'><li>If the shape of the object is long, curving cylinder having yellow-green colour then it will be labelled as - Banana.</li><li>If the shape of the object is rounded, small in size and has yellow colour then it will be labelled as - Grapes.</li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Supervised learning is further classified into two different categories of algorithms:</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-5'><li>Classification: If the output variable is a category theb the problem is known as classification, such as &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; or &ldquo;Black&rdquo;, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</li><li>Regression: If the output variable is a fixed value then the problem is known as regression, such as &ldquo;Height&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rupees&rdquo;.</li></ul><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>2. Unsupervised Learning.</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>The name itself says the input data is unsupervised. Means the data is not labelled and does not have a known result.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Here the task of the machine is to classify the unsorted information according to similarities, differences, and patterns without any prior training data. Unlike supervised learning, no training will be given to the machine.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/AI-ML/id40/id40.4.png' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>For instance, suppose it is given with an image which has dogs and cats in it.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Thus the machine has no idea about the features of cats and dogs so it cannot categorise it as &lsquo;dogs or cats&rsquo;. But it can categorise them according to their similarities, dissimilarities, and patterns i.e., we can easily categorize the above picture into two parts. The first may contain dogs and the second part may contain all pics of cats in them.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Unsupervised learning is also classified into two different categories of algorithms:</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-5'><li>Clustering: When you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, then it is known as a clustering problem. For example, grouping customers by purchasing behaviour.</li><li>Association: When you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, then the problem is known as association rule learning problem.</li></ul><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>3. Semi-supervised Learning.</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Here the input data is a mixture of labelled and unlabelled data. It is an approach to machine learning that combines a small amount of labelled data with a large amount of unlabelled data during training. Semi-supervised training falls between unsupervised learning (w<p class='fs-5 mb-5'>THANK YOU so much for reading it till here. I hope you found this tour useful.</p>",

      "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Swift is a great way to build phones, desktops, servers, or any other software that runs code. It's a safe, fast, and interactive programming language that combines the best of modern linguistic thinking with knowledge from the broader Apple engineering culture and the diverse contributions of the open source community. The compiler is optimised for performance and the language is both optimised for development without compromise.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Swift is friendly to new programmers. It's an industrial-grade programming language that's as expressive and fun as a scripting language. By writing Swift code in a playground, you can try your code and see the results immediately without the hassle of building and running an app.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Swift limits the major classes of general programming errors by adopting the latest programming patterns:</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Variables are always initialised before use. </li><li>The array index will be checked for out-of-bound errors. </li><li>Overflow of integers is checked. </li><li>Options guarantee that the null value is explicitly processed. </li><li>Memory is automatically managed. </li><li>Error processing enables controlled recovery from unexpected obstacles.</li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Swift code is compiled and optimised to take full advantage of modern hardware. The syntax and standard library were developed on the basic principle that the most obvious way to write code gives the best performance. The combination of security and speed makes Swift a great choice for everything from &ldquo;Hello world!&rdquo; to entire operating systems.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Swift combines powerful type inference and pattern recognition with modern, lightweight syntax to help you express complex ideas clearly and concisely. As a result, the code is not only easier to write, but easier to read and maintain. Swift is the result of combining the latest research in programming languages with decades of experience building Apple platforms. Named parameters are expressed in a clean syntax that makes Swift's APIs much easier to read and maintain. Even better, you don't even have to type the semicolon. Derived types make code cleaner and less error-prone, while modules eliminate headers and provide namespaces. For maximum support of international languages and emojis, strings are Unicode-enabled and use UTF-8-based encoding to optimise performance for a wide variety of use cases. Memory is automatically managed with strict deterministic reference counting, minimising memory usage without the overhead of garbage collection. Concurrent code can also be written using simple built-in keywords that define asynchronous behaviour, making the code easier to read and less error-prone.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/Android-Dev/id41/id41.1.png' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Swift is developed openly at Swift.org, with source code, bug trackers, forums, and regular development builds available for anyone to use. This broad developer community, both within Apple and with hundreds of external contributors, works together to make Swift even better. We have an even wider range of blogs, podcasts, conferences, and meetups where developers in our community share their experiences on how to realise the great potential of Swift.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Pros: </p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Swift is open source and easy to learn. </li><li>Swift is fast, secure, and expressive. </li><li>Swift is accessible and familiar (Swift programmers can insert C and C++ code into Swift applications). </li><li>Swift is the future of Apple development. </li><li>Swift is enterprise ready. </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Cons: </p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>The language is still young and the talent pool is limited. </li><li>Swift is considered a &ldquo;moving target&rdquo; because it is a new language and there are few Swift programmers. </li><li>Poor interoperability with third-party tools and IDEs. No support for earlier IOS versions. </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Swift has been under development for years and is constantly evolving with new features and capabilities. You can use Swift today to create an entirely new application, or use Swift code to implement new functionality in your app. Swift code coexists with existing Objective-C files in the same project and has full access to Objective-C APIs, making adoption easier.</p>",

You&apos;ve got your IDE set up, your Android SDK downloaded, and you&apos;re ready to start building apps. But what about when you want to add a little bit of flair to your app? That&apos;s where Flutter comes in. Flutter is a mobile app SDK that allows you to build beautiful, fast, native-quality apps for both iOS and Android. Best of all, it&apos;s easy to use. In this article, we&apos;ll take a look at how to use Flutter Flow to create an Android app that looks and feels great. So what are you waiting for? Get started with Flutter Flow today and see the difference it can make in your app development process</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>WHAT IS FLUTTER FLOW?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>An online tool called FlutterFlow makes it simple for anyone to create native cross-platform applications. The most well-known cross-platform developer framework, Google&apos;s Flutter, gets a visual builder with FlutterFlow. Cross-platform mobile app development and iteration is currently expensive and time-consuming, but with FlutterFlow teams and individuals can use the user-friendly interface and higher level abstractions to build apps 10x faster. The startup is run by former Google software developers who used machine learning to enhance the data in Google Maps.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>How to get the most out of Flutter Flow in your Android development ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>If you&apos;re looking to get the most out of Flutter Flow in your Android development, here are some tips:</p></p class='fs-5 mb-4'><ol><li>Use Flutter Flow to generate code for your UI. This will save you time and effort in writing boilerplate code.</li><li>Take advantage of Flutter Flow&apos;s hot reload feature to quickly iterate on your UI.</li><li>Use Flutter Flow&apos;s built-in debugging tools to troubleshoot issues with your app.</li></ol></p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/Android-Dev/id42/id42.1.png' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>With these tips, you&apos;ll be able to get the most out of using Flutter Flow in your Android development projects.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>How does FlutterFlow benefit Android developers?</h2> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>When compared to native SDK development, Flutter speeds up the process by 40%. The fundamental draw of Flutter is its extensive library of customizable widgets that operate better than we would anticipate, with performance that seems native. Flutter&apos;s Hot reload feature helps developers find flaws more quickly and resolve them in real time. Flutter doesn&apos;t use the platform UI when it comes to user interface. It renders everything on its own and enables programmers to create applications with excellent UX.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>PROS:</h2><ul><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>All platforms have the same UI and business logic.</h2></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Experts know that virtually any cross-platform framework allows codebase sharing between target platforms. Apart from Flutter, there are no other application frameworks that allow sharing of both the UI code and the UI itself.</p><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Time Saved on Code Development.</h2></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The “hot reload” feature of Flutter allows you to see the applied changes almost instantly, without losing the current application state. And it is precisely because of this increased development speed that Flutter app development is several times faster.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Furthermore, the Flutter team has worked hard to provide a wide range of ready-to-use widgets. The majority of them are highly customizable, saving you time like no other framework before it. Flutter provides a large set of Material and Cupertino widgets that perfectly mimic the behaviour of each design language, in addition to numerous core layout widgets. This is how they work:</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/Android-Dev/id42/id42.2.png' alt=''><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Any complexity of custom, animated UI is available.</h2></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>One of the most significant advantages of Flutter is the ability to customise anything you see on the screen, no matter how complex it is. While it is usually possible to create a highly customised UI on native platforms as well, the amount of effort required varies by order of magnitude. Here&apos;s an example of a simple yet customised user interface:</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='https://hack-club-sigce-blogs.web.app/assets/images/Android-Dev/id42/id42.3.png' alt=''><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Own Rendering Engine</h2></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Flutter allows you to do so many things with your apps that other platforms do not. Obviously, it necessitates a fairly powerful framework. In fact, without a high-performance cross-platform rendering engine, most of the points presented above would be impossible</p><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>The Potential to Extend Beyond Mobile</h2></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Flutter allows you to go far beyond mobile app development. Flutter for Web and Flutter Desktop Embeddings are also available. Google presented a technical preview of Flutter Web at this year&apos;s I/O conference, allowing pure Flutter applications to run in a browser without modifying the source code.</p></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>CONS:</h2><ul><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>FlutterFlow UI rendering and constraints.</h2></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Flutter is not like the other frameworks available today. A flutter app is made up of widgets that are rendered to a Skia canvas, which is displayed by the platform and responds to events. This model has the potential to produce high-performance results. The developer is limited by Flutter&apos;s own UI rendering feature. Assume you need to incorporate a video player into your application. You can do it with Flutter video player widgets, but they look different than the native ones, especially on iOS.</p><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>In FlutterFlow, there is no standard or universally accepted architectural approach.</h2></li><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Developers typically use Clean Architecture and MVP (model-view-presenter) in Android SDKs, whereas MVC, MVVM (model-view-ViewModel), or Viper in iOS SDKs. There is a clear well-known architectural pattern for a large project in both platforms. Unfortunately, there is no &apos;standard&apos; or &apos;universally-accepted&apos; architectural approach for Flutter. If you are a developer working on a large project, you should have a clear idea of how to structure it to make the app more scalable and easy to maintain as it grows in size and complexity</p></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>So, Should you go with Flutter?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Like any new technology, flutter has its advantages and disadvantages. The process of creating apps is undoubtedly made simpler by Flutter, and from our observations, flutter apps have extremely less crash activity. The scale of the development community, however, is flutter&apos;s largest drawback in our opinion. However, with time, we may anticipate that the community will become stronger and contribute to additional improvements for the framework. Although it works brilliantly for some projects, it isn&apos;t yet the best option for a wide range of applications and use scenarios. The same as any cross-platform technology, it has drawbacks.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>CONCLUSION:</h2><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Why FlutterFlow?</h3><ul><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>The Best Low-Code Tool For Founders and Entrepreneurs.</h2></li><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Build your MVP or mobile app 10x faster.</h2></li><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Never Start From Scratch With Customizable Templates.</h2></li><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Gather Feedback and Iterate Quickly.</h2></li><li><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Save Development Time and Costs With One Codebase.</h2></li></ul>",

      "blogContent":"<h1 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Adobe a new dimension to editing.</h1><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The average attention span of a Human is about 8.25 seconds. That&apos;s make the graphic job more difficult and challenging. The task to quickly draw someone&apos;s attention and to keep them attentive, is what most graphic designers are facing these days.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>And here comes the Adobe! You heard me. The savior of the editing world. The hero without a cape! And there are indeed plenty of reasons, as to why I am saying this. It&apos;s not like they paid me or anything (Arghh, why didn&apos;t they!), but I myself found it very useful and a must having thing!</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>EVER HEARD OF ADOBE?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Adobe Inc is an <b>American multinational computer software</b>company, which over the years have developed numerous software and applications for graphic creation and manipulation. In simpler terms, they create software that helps in the editing work of any kind of graphics, it may be photos or videos.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Adobe is not just one software or application, instead it is a whole army of such. There are different software/applications for different kind of things. There is always some uniqueness that each of this product have for themselves and that is what makes them very sustainable in the current global market.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Creative Cloud, a new world!</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Adobe is a deep-rooted brand that offers you a ton of apps and software which makes you limitless in the world of productivity and content creation.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Some of them are,</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Photoshop</li><li>Lightroom</li><li>Illustrator</li><li>Adobe XD</li><li>After Effects</li><li>Premiere Pro</li><li>Acrobat Pro</li></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>IT HAS ITS OWN ECOSYSTEM!</h2></p class='fs-5 mb-4'> There are ton of instances where one needs to work on a project but by using many <b>devices</b> at once. Now it&apos;s not a smart move to start from scratch every time you switch the device. </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Sometimes, a group of people has to work on a certain project and it&apos;s not efficient to conduct offline meets and doing it on a single device. And my friend, if you are relating to this, then Adobe is your savior!</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Using the creative cloud, you can access projects on many devices simultaneously. With adobe you can sync many devices together. Any changes made on one device; will reflect onto all the devices that you have connected. So, a group of people could work together saving a lot of time. So convenient, isn&apos;t it?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>To know more about the synchronization feature, I have the official link <a href='https://helpx.adobe.com/in/creative-cloud/help/sync-creative-cloud-files.html'>HERE</a></p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Networking the adobe!</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Syncing is one fraction of a feature. Let me present the handiest and lifesaving feature, “Integrating and plug ins”. </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Now many of us and our friends use third party apps or more than one <b>application</b> to work on a single project. And sometimes it becomes hectic to just keep exporting one project among different software. </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Guess what! Your guy adobe is here. Adobe gives you the power to connect various productive apps, collaborative tools and other design tools to its creative cloud. And believe the amount of time and clicks you can save is just amazing.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Now, I am talking here about different <b>software</b> and not different <b>devices</b>! Although, we have covered that previously.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Here is the <a href='https://www.adobe.com/in/creativecloud/extensibility.html'>LINK</a>, if you want to know more about it.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Maintaining the workflow is the key, my friend!”</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>PRICING AND PREMIUMS</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Now, let&apos;s get down to the business. Are they offering their services free? Absolutely not, but absolutely yes! Fuzzy now, isn&apos;t it? The company isn&apos;t making just one software, and it is expected that not everything is going to be free of cost. </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>But wait, there are certain things that the Adobe has provided for free. And they are more than enough to give a glimpse of what they hold for our future!</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Some of the free applications/software (subject to change): -</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Adobe Photoshop for iPad</li><li>Photoshop</li><li>Adobe Creative Cloud Express</li><li>Photoshop Mix</li><li>Lightroom mobile cc</li><li>Adobe Premiere Rush</li><li>Illustrator Draw </li><li>Adobe XD</li><li>Adobe Color</li><li>Adobe Acrobat Reader</li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Some of their features are free to use while other features are the paid ones!
