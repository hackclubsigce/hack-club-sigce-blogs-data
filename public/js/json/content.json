            "shortDesc": "Install Kali Linux as a Portable Live USB for Pen-Testing & Hacking on Any Computer",
            "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-3'>&emsp;Kali Linux is the go-to Linux distribution for penetration testing and ethical hacking. Still, it's not recommended for day-to-day use, such as responding to emails, playing games, or checking Facebook. That's why it's better to run your Kali Linux system from a bootable USB drive.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>The hacker-friendly Debian-based distro did receive a major update by Offensive Security in late-2019 that changed the default desktop environment from the heavyweight Gnome to a more lightweight Xfce, making Kali more snappy and responsive overall. But we still can't recommend it as your daily driver unless you hack 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Using Kali in a dual-boot situation is the way to go if you have a dedicated machine, but for something more portable, the live version on a USB flash drive is what you want. If you have a spare computer that you're going to be using for your white-hat endeavors only, then yes, by all means, install Kali as the primary system so that you can take full use of the computer's hardware. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-3 mt-5'>What You'll Need :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>&emsp;To follow along, you'll need a USB flash drive. You could get away with using one as small as 4 GB for the basics or 8 GB if you want persistence, but a larger one may come in handy, especially if you want the ability to save data. When it comes to 4 GB USB sticks, you'll mostly only find USB 2.0 speeds unless you spend a crazy amount of money on an Kingston IronKey or iStorage datAshur Pro with 256-bit encryption.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>You'll also need the Kali Live ISO file and an imaging program like Etcher or Rufus, which we'll outline below.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-1 : Download the Right Kali Linux Version</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>While there are many different types of Kali Linux images, the one we want for a portable live version is the \"Live\" download. You can choose between 64-Bit for AMD (for Intel chips), 64-Bit for ARM64 (such as the M1 chips in newer Macs), and 32-Bit for i386 (which you likely won't ever use because it's so outdated).</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Visit <a target=\"_blank\" href='kali.org/downloads'>Kali</a> and download the appropriate Live image. We'll be using the 64-Bit for AMD since we're using an Intel Chip. No matter which one you choose, note that you will only be able to use the Xfce desktop environment, and you won't be able to specify additional (meta)packages to install.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/assets/images/General/id2/id2.1.jpg\"/></div><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-2 : Install a USB Formatting Tool</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>On Linux and macOS computers, you could use the dd command to copy over the Kali Live image to the USB drive, but you always run the risk of choosing the wrong drive and royally screwing yourself over by overwriting an important drive. Because of that, we recommend using a USB formatting tool. If you're on Windows, Rufus is a good tool, but Etcher works for Linux, macOS, and Windows, so we're using that.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Head to balena.io/etcher and his the \"Download\" button, which should detect which system you're on ad give you the right version. If not, hit the drop-down button next to it to choose your OS. Once downloaded, install it like you would any other app. For example, on macOS, open the DMG, drag balenaEtcher over to your Applications folder, then eject the DMG and delete it.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/assets/images/General/id2/id2.2.jpg\"/></div><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-3 : Flash the Kali Live Image to the Flash Drive</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Open Etcher, then click on \"Select Image.\" You may see options for \"Flash from file\" and \"Flash from URL\" instead; choose \"Flash from file\" if you see that.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/assets/images/General/id2/id2.3.jpg\"/></div><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Navigate to the Kali image you downloaded in Step 1, and select it. Then, you need to click on \"Select Target\" to choose your USB flash drive. Double- and triple-check that you're selecting the right drive by looking at the drive name and space available.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/assets/images/General/id2/id2.4.jpg\" /></div><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Now all that's left to do is click on \"Flash!\" This will reformat your flash drive so that everything will be erased and overwritten with the Kali Live image.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/assets/images/General/id2/id2.5.jpg\"/></div><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>You may be asked to input your admin password to let Etcher do its magic, so go ahead and do that if it happens. Then, Etcher will show a progress bar indicating how much time is left for flashing the content over. You'll see a \"Flash Complete\" message when it's done.</p><div class=\"mb-4\"> <img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" src=\"/assets/images/General/id2/id2.6.jpg\"/></div><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-4 : Boot from the Kali Live USB</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Now it's time to boot to your new Kali Live USB flash drive, but the process will vary based on the computer brand, operating system, and processor.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>On macOS, it's much easier. If you have an Apple M1 chip, just power down your Mac, then turn it on and hold the power button until you see the startup window. On Intel-based Macs, press the Option key immediately after turning on or restarting the computer until you see the startup window. Then, just select the Kali Live flash drive to boot from.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>To find out how to enter BIOS and change the boot settings, and/or load the startup menu, google \"boot from USB drive\" for your computer model and OS and find the appropriate instructions. There are just too many to list here where there are plenty of good manuals online with instructions for booting from external disks.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-5 : Choose How You Want to Boot Kali</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Once you've booted into the Kali Live USB flash drive, you should see a few different options for which version of Kali you want to load. They may include:</p><ul class=\"fs-5 mb-3\"> <li><strong>Live system</strong> : This will boot up Kali Live. In this mode, you cannot save any changes. No reports, no logs, no other data — none of these changes are saved. This way, you start with a fresh Kali Live every time you boot it up. Data is only saved to RAM, not the drive.</li><li><strong>Live system (fail-safe mode)</strong> : Same as the live system, but a more robust version in case the system fails. That way, the failed system won't ruin your flash drive. This is a good option if you need to troubleshoot a problematic computer.</li><li><strong>Live system (forensic mode): </strong> : Same as the live system with forensic-friendly tools so that you can recover files, gather evidence, and perform other forensic tasks on a host machine. However, the internal hard drive is never touched, and external devices and media will not auto-mount so that you have complete control over what you can connect to.</li><li><strong>Live system (persistence) : </strong> Same as the live system, only changes will be saved, and it will allow you to inspect the host system without worrying about running or locked processes.</li><li><strong>Live system (encrypted persistence): </strong> Same as the live system (persistence), only encrypted with LUKS, so it's harder for others to access your data.</li><li><strong>Live system (encrypted persistence): </strong> Same as the live system (persistence), only encrypted with LUKS, so it's harder for others to access your data.</li><li><strong>Start installer: </strong> This lets you start the installer to install Kali on an internal drive.</li><li><strong>Start installer with speech synthesis: </strong> Same as start installer, only with speech instructions to help navigate.</li><li><strong>Advanced options: </strong> Includes options such as MemTest, Hardware Detection, etc..</li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>To boot it up without saving any changes, just choose the \"Live system\" option, which will take you right into the new Xfce desktop environment as a non-root user. However, if you want to save your changes, boot using \"Live system (persistence)\" or \"Live system (encrypted persistence)\" instead.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-6 : Set Up Persistence on Kali Live</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>Choosing one of the persistence options doesn't mean it'll work out of the box. There is some configuration to perform first, mainly creating a new partition to save all your data. Kali has some excellent instructions on doing so, which we are using.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-3'>To create a partition above the Kali Live partitions, ending at 7 GB, issue the following three commands in a terminal window as the kali user, which will keep the Live options in the 7 GB partition, freeing up the rest for your data storage. Make sure you're doing this from your Kali Live system you just booted into.</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ end=7GiB\n~$ read start _ &#60; &#60;(du -bcm kali-linux-2021.1-live-arm64.iso | tail -1); echo $start\n~$ parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary ${start}MiB $end</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>When that's done, you should now have a third partition labeled something like /dev/sdb3 or /dev/disk1s3. Check your volume identifier because you'll need it for the rest of this process.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>If you want to add some encryption in case you think someone might get a hold of your drive, issue the following two commands as kali. Type \"YES\" in all caps if prompted to proceed with overwriting the new partition. When asked for a passphrase, choose one and enter it twice. You can skip encryption if you don't want it.</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ cryptsetup --verbose --verify-passphrase luksFormat /dev/sdb3\n~$ cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb3 my_usb</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Next, run the following two commands as kali to create an ext3 file system labeled \"persistence.\" If you chose to skip encryption, use these:</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ mkfs.ext3 -L persistence /dev/sdb3\n~$ e2label /dev/sdb3 persistence</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Next, run the following two commands as kali to create an ext3 file system labeled \"persistence.\" If you chose to skip encryption, use these:</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ mkfs.ext3 -L persistence /dev/sdb3\n~$ e2label /dev/sdb3 persistence</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>If you encrypted the partition, use:</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ mkfs.ext3 -L persistence /dev/mapper/my_usb\n~$ e2label /dev/mapper/my_usb persistence</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Next, create a mount point, mount the new partition there, create a configuration file to enable persistence, then unmount the partition. If you didn't encrypt the partition, use : </p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ mkdir -p /mnt/my_usb\n~$ mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt/my_usb\n~$ echo \"/ union\" > /mnt/my_usb/persistence.conf\n~$ umount /dev/sdb3</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>If you encrypted the partition, use : </p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ mkdir -p /mnt/my_usb/\n~$ mount /dev/mapper/my_usb /mnt/my_usb\n~$ echo \"/ union\" > /mnt/my_usb/persistence.conf\n~$ umount /dev/mapper/my_usb</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>If you didn't encrypt the partition, you're done. If you did, you have one more command to issue as kali, which will close the encrypted channel for the new partition : </p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/my_usb</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>Now, reboot into Kali Live and choose the appropriate system, and everything should be all set.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-5 mt-5'>Step-7 : Add a Password for the Root User</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>On new versions of Kali, you're a non-root user by default, but you can issue root commands as a regular user by using:</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~$ sudo su</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-5'>If you're asked for a password, use kali. However, Kali Live might not attach a password to the root user, so you'll have to create one if you don't want other people to get in and mess with your system. If it does have one, you can change it to something better. Use passwd root with root privileges to do that. Enter your chosen password, then verify it.</p><pre class='language-html'><code >~# passwd \n\nrootNew password:Retype \nnew password: \n\npasswd: password updated successfully</code></pre>",

            "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>I am quite sure we all know who Mr. Elon Musk is! But for the record Elon Reeve Musk FRS is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let us travel back a year behind, if someone says Elon Musk the first thing that came to our mind was Tesla or SpaceX. But now if we hear the name Elon Musk the first thing that comes to our mind is Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency. That is what Mr. Musk has changed in past 1 year. What is Cryptocurrency though? Well A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as a medium of exchange. Individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Why is Elon Musk a Crypto Wizard?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well apart from building spaceships and sending cars into space or creating worlds most advance electric vehicles. Elon Musk has a reputation of playing with the crypto market. Every time Mr. Musk has tweeted something regarding crypto currencies the crypto market has reacted and changed drastically. But what actually happened ?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>On 4th June 2021 Mr. Musk sitting on his expensive sofa just tweeted a breakup heart emoji with #BITCOIN.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>But what can a tweet really do?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well, the value of Bitcoin sank from $64,000 to $30,000 in 1 night. Yes, that’s a steep fall especially for heavy bitcoin investors.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='/assets/images/General/id5/id5.1.png'/><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Along with Bitcoin even Ethereum and Dogecoin fell.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well, this was not the first time where such a thing happened. In May Mr. Musk said that Tesla will not be accepting any payments in Bitcoins due to heavy energy usage. Due to this the whole cryptocurrency market fell in one day.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Elon Musk tweeted that he owns only 3 crypto currencies I.E. </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>On 25th October 2021.</p><ol class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Bitcoin</li><li>Ethereum</li><li>Dogecoin</li></ol><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>This is the sole reason these 3 are the highest performing cryptos. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>But why can Elon Musk control the whole Crypto market ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The main reason is he owns two largest powerhouses that accepts payments in the form of cryptocurrencies. It is also because of his social media influence and impact of his opinion on crypto markets.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>So make sure you check twitter before investing in crypto market next time !</p>",

Let's look into the technical terms based on which the actual code runs. Focusing sequentially on </p><ol class='fs-5 mb-5'> <li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>JavaScript</li></ol><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>HTML :</h2><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>What is HTML ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Structure of HTML Element</h2><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='/assets/images/Web-Dev/id6/id6.1.jpg' ><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>To provide additional information to the HTML element there is a concept called HTML attributes.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>HTML Attributes:</h2><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>HTML attributes are the special words which provide additional information to the HTML element.</li><li>Each element or tag can have their own attributes</li><li>There are few attributes which are known as global attributes, since they can be applied to any element present in the HTML document. e.g., style, class, id, title, etc.</li><li>Attribute names are case sensitive and should be written in lowercase only.</li><li>There can be multiple attributes in the same element.</li></ul><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='/assets/images/Web-Dev/id6/id6.2.png' ><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>CSS Syntax :</h2><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='/assets/images/Web-Dev/id6/id6.3.png'><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>What Is CSS ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>JavaScript :-</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable : </p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>var</li><li>let</li><li>const</li></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>var :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Variable is a container that is used for storing data (values). It basically works like math algebra wherein, you assign values. <br>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>var x=5;<br>var y=6;<br>var z = x + y;<br>//Apparently, var z will store the value 11.</code></pre>All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.These unique names are called identifiers.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>let :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>let can declare the JS variable in the same way as we did with “var”. Just the case with “let” is that it does not let you re-declare a variable that is already declared.<br>Eg - <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>let x = \"HackClub\";<br>let x = \"7\";<br>// SyntaxError : ‘x’ has already been declared.</code></pre> </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>const :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In const you can’t re-declare or re-assign a declared variable. JS const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.<br>Eg - <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>const dec = 12;</code></pre> As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>JS DataTypes : </h2> <ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>String : A string ( or a text string ) is a series of characters like “sunny day”.</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>let quote = 'The best way to predict the future is to create it.';</code></pre> <li>JS Numbers : JavaScript has only one type of numbers. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>let y = 69;<br>let z = 07;</code></pre> <li>JS Booleans : Booleans only have 2 values. It is used when you have only 2 values like yes/no, true/false, on/off.</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\">let x = 7;<br>let y = 8;<br>let z = 7;<br>( x == y ) // returns false.<br>( x == z ) // returns true.<code></code></pre> <li>JS Arrays : Array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value. An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.</li>Syntax : <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];</code></pre> <li>JS Objects : It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>const person = {name:'John', age: 23, height:'5.9 feet'};</code></pre> <li>JS Undefined : In JS, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>let pool; // Value is undefined, type will also be undefined.</code></pre> <li>Empty values : Empty values does not imitate “undefined”, it is a different data type</li>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>let pool=''; // The value is '', the typeof is 'string'.</code></pre></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>JS Functions :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Imagine If a person has to make a call in the evening. The first thing he will do is set a reminder which will alert him about the call in the evening. In the same way a function generally works. JS Function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task and it is executed when “something” invokes it (calls it).</p>Eg :<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>function myFunction(p1, p2){<br>    return p1 * p2; // The function returns the product of p1 and p2<br>}</code></pre><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets:{}</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Function Invocation : </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will 'return' to execute the code after the invoking statement.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Functions often compute a return value. The return value is 'returned' back to the 'caller'.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Why Functions?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results”.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The () Operator Invokes the Function</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Note : Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>FRAMEWORKS :</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Web Application Framework or simply “web framework” is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Frameworks are, in short, libraries that help you develop your application faster and smarter!</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Web FrameWorks like “BOOTSTRAP”, “SEMANTIC UI”, “TAILWIND”, “MATERIALIZE CSS”, etc are generally based on HTML, CSS and JS which helps in creating intriguing, responsive and interactive web designs.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>JS LIBRARIES :</h2><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li> <h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>What is a JavaScript Library?</h2> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>A library is a JavaScript file that contains a bunch of functions, and those functions accomplish some useful tasks for your webpage. Most libraries have documentation with a list of available functions or a real-world example.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Some of the most preferred JS libraries are JQuery, AngularJS, Vue.JS, ReactJS, they also allow developers to create scalable single-page websites.</p></li></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>This might lead to a question: </h2> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>What is the difference between a Framework and a Library?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>“Front-End is all about being technically creative while delivering a responsive web design”</h2>",

            "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Unsupervised Machine Learning is a type of Machine Learning algorithm in which the data provided to the model is not labeled. Here the model needs to find the hidden patterns from the dataset by itself to get trained. This model is trained based on an unlabeled dataset.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In simple terms, this is analogous to a student not being trained using solved examples by the teacher but instead, the student has to train himself using unsolved examples and find its solutions.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>As this student does not need a teacher, similarly our model does not need any kind of supervision here. Hence it's called Unsupervised Machine Learning.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Unsupervised Machine Learning cannot be applied to regression and classification problems because here unlike supervised Machine Learning no output data is present.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let's understand it with an example:</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Here we have input data as the number of images of cats and dogs. This image data is unlabeled or uncategorized. Now, these images are passed to the model, but here only the input data(i.e images) are passed whereas output data(labels like cat or dog) is not passed. Also, no features are already provided to the model while the training process, rather the model has to identify the features by itself.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='/assets/images/AI-ML/id8/id8.1.png' ><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Here by features I mean that the above characteristics of these two animals differentiate them as cats or dogs. These features are to be identified by the model by itself during the training process(i.e identifying the hidden patterns). Once these features of cats and dogs are identified by the model, its task is to separate these two types of images into different clusters. Once the hidden patterns are identified now it selects the appropriate unsupervised machine learning algorithm such as k-means clustering, Apriori algorithm, KNN Classification, etc and then classifies the images with similar features as part of one cluster(or group) and the dissimilar images as part of another cluster(or group).</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='/assets/images/AI-ML/id8/id8.2.png' ><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Similarly, the cats and dogs are grouped into two different clusters by applying the suitable algorithm and now after clustering, labels are assigned to these clusters(i.e one cluster belongs to cats and the other cluster belongs to dogs).</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Another Example:</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Here various shapes are provided as input data to the model as raw data for identifying the hidden patterns from the data.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='/assets/images/AI-ML/id8/id8.3.png' ><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>After that, a suitable algorithm is applied and the shapes are categorized into different clusters labeled as triangle, cube, and circle.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Below is the difference between a supervised machine learning algorithm and an unsupervised machine learning algorithm:</h3><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='/assets/images/AI-ML/id8/id8.4.png' ><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In supervised Machine Learning, input data (images of apple) along with the labels is passed to the model and the model is trained based on these images and labels. Once the model is trained, then it is checked with the set of unknown data and gives the label of the unknown image as predicted output.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In unsupervised machine learning, the images of bananas, apples, and peaches will be passed without labels. Once these images are passed the model identifies the features and based on this, divides them into different clusters as the output.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Types of Unsupervised Machine Learning</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The Unsupervised Machine Learning can be divided into two types:</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='/assets/images/AI-ML/id8/id8.5.png' ><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Clustering:</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Clustering is a technique that is used to group similar items or data into one cluster and dissimilar items or data into another cluster. The similarity is measured by identifying the features and then mapping these features as similar or dissimilar.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Types of Clustering Algorithm:</h3><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Exclusive Clustering Algorithm</li><li>Overlapping Clustering Algorithm</li><li>Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm</li><li>Probabilistic Clustering Algorithm</li></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Association:</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Association rule is used to establish a relationship or associations between data objects or variables in large datasets. It is widely used to make the market strategy more effective like if a customer is buying product X(bread) then he is more likely to buy product Y, Z( eggs, butter/jam). Hence, you can observe that eggs, butter, jam, etc are always kept beside bread in malls and supermarkets as a marketing strategy. This is called Market Basket Analysis which helps to develop relationships between various products.Another example can be people who have bought a new house are more likely to buy new furniture.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Types of Association Algorithms</h3><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Apriori Algorithm</li><li>FP Growth Algorithm</li><li>Eclat</li></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Advantages:</h2><ol class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Used to gain better insights from the data.</li><li>It works with unlabeled and uncategorized data.</li><li>In the real world, we don't always have the output to the corresponding input data.

CSS is a style sheet language used for presentation of a website written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4'>What is BOOTSTRAP ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Bootstrap is a free and open source CSS framework…..Yes bootstrap is evolved from CSS !

It is very important to learn the basics first and to strengthen your roots. Bootstrap doesn't really require any learning or practice, a person with basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript can also work with Bootstrap flawlessly.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4'>What should you use 🤔?</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Your decision totally depends upon what project you are working on.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>If you are working on a project that requires less customization and has a limited time period than Bootstrap is your go to option. Customization is limited in Bootstrap but you can quickly create websites using Bootstrap.</li><li>If your project requires a client specific design and features than Bootstrap would be a little difficult to execute. CSS is the best option for such projects. Though this method would be time consuming, but a good team can execute it in no time.</li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>These were some points regarding CSS v/s Bootstrap, I hope I have cleared your doubts, nevertheless use the language you are comfortable with, cause at the end of the day the client only requires his desired output. </p>",

            "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is not just like white fluffy things in the sky…</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Before proceeding further, we must understand the term which is cloud.</p><h2 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>What is Cloud?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>'The term Cloud' can be considered as a global network of remote server access over the internet, where the software and databases run together. Before the concept of Cloud Computing came into the picture, each company managed their physical servers and access services from their own machines. Because of that they faced a lot of problems like high maintenance cost, security issues, unreliability, data loss and many more.</p><h2 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>Cloud Computing</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Cloud computing is a technology which stores and access services - including servers, database, networking, software, analytics & intelligence over the internet in the place of your computer's hard drive. In simple term Instead of storing and accessing the services from your personal computer, you are accessing them over the internet by using any internet dependent device.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let's take an example, Email is an online communication service, like Gmail. If you use Gmail, you are not hosting your own email server. Google is hosting it, and you are just accessing it through your user device as a client. It works same with large companies when they switch to cloud computing it will reduce cost for storage, improve performance and speed, more reliability with high security.</p><h2 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>Types of Cloud Computing</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It may happen that everyone's need and purpose for type of cloud service deployment is different from each other. For that you have to decide that what kind of accessibility you want for your company. There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: Public cloud, Private cloud, Hybrid cloud.</p><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>1. Public cloud</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It can be a free or paid on-demand computing services owned by third-party cloud service providers, in which they provide us their computers storage, servers over the internet. In this scenario multiple users can use same storage given by any organization simultaneously and also cloud service providers are responsible for all management and maintenance of the system. Some examples are Google cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services cloud.</p><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>2. Private cloud</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is also known as Internal Cloud which offers many of the services from Public cloud with self-service, scalability and elasticity. In this case the scenario is high level of security and privacy provided with inaccessibility of third party providers.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Services are only provided within the organization and select users rather than general public. One drawback is that the company is responsible for whatever the cost required to manage private cloud. Microsoft, HP Data Centre, Ubuntu are some examples of private cloud.</p><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>3. Hybrid cloud</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is a combination of both Public and Private cloud which allows you to share the data and applications in between them. It will give you more flexibility and deployment options, security, enhancement in existing architecture. Some companies that uses Hybrid cloud that are Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Cisco.</p><h2 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>Types of Cloud Services</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>This is also called as stack of services the reason behind that is they build on the top of the other. The three major types of cloud services are following:</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id14/id14.1.jpg' ><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>1. Infrastructure as a service</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>IaaS allows you to use their IT infrastructure such as Servers, Virtual machines, Networking, Storage, and other resources. You are able to access this services on the basis of pay-as-per-use model. Simply they enable users to access their pre-defined hardware configuration for specific period of time on rent. This service can be offered for each type of the cloud computing models.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let's take an example, Assume that you are a person who live in a room on rent in a house and gives money to the owner as more time as you lived. Owner of the room gives you limited things to access.</p><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>2. Platform as a service</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is a type of service which gives you environment to Deploy, Test, Deliver, Update, and manage the software applications. Application can be a web or mobile one just to make some easiness for developers. Here we don't need to worry about setting and managing up the infrastructure of server.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It is consist of all services of IaaS including Development tools, Application design, testing, Database Management System, Business intelligence and many more. Examples- Azure, Google App Engine, etc.</p><h3 class='fw-border mb-4 mt-5'>3. Software as a service</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>SaaS allows you to connect and use applications based on cloud over the internet. Here the cloud service provider is only responsible for managing software and hardware like software upgrades and security patching with availability as well as security of your data.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Examples are Google Apps, Drop Box, Big Commerce, Slack, etc.</p>",

What is JAVA Programming Language?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Java is an object-oriented programming language that produces software multiple platforms . When a programmers write a java applications, The compiled code runs on most operating systems, including windows Mac OS. Syntax of Java from the C and C++programming languages. The format of bytecode is platform-independent. A virtual machine, called the JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE, is used to run the bytecode on each platform.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>2. Implementation of Java</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The implementation is divided into two different distributions:</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which provides the minimum requirements for executing a java application, it consist of Java Virtual Machine(JVM),core classes and supporting files.</li><li>Java Development Kit (JDK) which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the Java compiler, Javadoc, Jar, and a debugger.</li></ul><img class='img-fluid rounded ' src='assets/images/General/id16/id16.1.png' alt=''><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>3. Features of Java</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Java has multiple features. Some of these are unique to Java Object Oriented – In Java, everything is represented as objects. An object is kind of wrapper that encapsulated data and its associated behavior.Java provides support for all major object-oriented principles as seen in other object-oriented languages.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Platform Independent – A program compiled on one machine can be executed on any machine in the world without any change.It is very different to C or C++ applications where programs compiled into binaries specific to OS.</li><li>Compiled -Java compiler compiles the java source code into the bytecode. Java Virtual Machine(JVM) executes this bytecode which is executable on many operating system. </li><li>Secure – Java applications run in Java runtime environment (JRE) with almost no interaction with system OS. It makes Java more secure than other languages.</li><li>Multithreaded – Java supports writing applications which can do multiple tasks in separate threads. For example, a Java application serve a user login form while running background processes also.</li><li>OS Architecture-neutral – Java compiler generates an OS architecture-neutral class files or bytecode.</li></ul><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>4. How to write code in java</h2><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id16/id16.2.jpeg' alt=''><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li> First of all we have to make a Java source files must be named after the public class they contain, putting the suffix .java, for example, HelloWorldApplication.java. </li><li> It must first be compiled into bytecode, using a Java compiler, producing a file named HelloWorldApplication.class . Only then can it be executed.</li><li>The Java source file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with other than public access and any number of public inner classes.</li><li> When the source file contains multiple classes, make one class ‘public’ and name the source file with that public class name.</li></ul>",

They know that it becomes easy to write any code in python that’s why if you want to be a competitive programmer you would have to go with C++ as it is a little bit faster in nature. In industries, Java is most used language but now if you think to choose java then just keep one thing in mind that whenever you enter in any company then you have to learn the language which is used by that company. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>How to Write a Simple Program in C++</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Before moving forward let’s see how a basic C++ program looks like. This is a code to write a hello world program in C++</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id17/id17.1.jpg' alt=''><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Object Oriented Programing in C++</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>C++ is object oriented programming language. Main aim of OOP’s in any programing language is to implement real examples in a program by binding data members (variables) and member functions (functions) together using classes and objects. There are four principles of OOP’s in C++ below we will explain them one by one. Following is one example of how to create class and object in C++</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id17/id17.2.jpg' alt=''><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>1. Encapsulation</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The idea of encapsulation is <b>bundling or tying</b> data and methods that operate on that data. The main purpose of encapsulation in OOP is to preventing our data which is inside the class from outsiders to directly access. It mean’s anyone can access your data but not directly. They can access encapsulated data just by taking help of some methods like <b>getters and setters</b>.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id17/id17.3.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The output of the above program will be…</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Krutika is 19 years old”</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>2.Abstraction</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In programming abstraction means displaying essential information and hiding complex or non-essential information from the user. In this concept we are going to create a class that will represent a method and that method which is able to perform addition operation will hide the complexity from user. We have two ways to implement abstraction in C++ i.e.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id17/id17.4.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let’s see how we can implement abstraction using methods from abstract class…</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id17/id17.5.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The output of the above program will be…</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Sum is 200”</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>3.Inheritance</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The concept of inheritance is same like the concept of parent-child example. A base class (sub class) can derive or access the public properties of parent class (super class) is called Inheritance. Base/child class is a class which is inhering the members of parent class and class whose members are inherited called parent class. This principle is mainly used for code reusability. There are five types of inheritance in C++</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id17/id17.6.jpg' alt=''><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id17/id17.7.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The output of the above program will be…</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Parent member value is 10”</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Child member value is 30”</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>4.Polymorphism</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The meaning of Polymorphism is “many-forms” and it occurs when we implement inheritance in our program. Suppose you have a method called Dance () in parent class and another method with same name in derived class with their own implementation then the concept of polymorphism came into the picture. By going through the above example you will be able to understand what polymorphism is.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id17/id17.8.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The output of the above program will be…</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Dancing”</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Dancing Hip-Hop”</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Access Modifier</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Access modifier is used to specify the accessible area for data members and functions of a class. You should remember one thing that everything in C++ is private by default. We have three Access Modifiers in C++: Public, Private and Protected.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>Public:</b> It can be accessible for everyone</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>Private:</b> It can be access within a class</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'><b>Protected:</b> It can’t be access outside of its class except derived class (sub class) of that class</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Constructor</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>A constructor is a special type of function automatically called when object of that class created to initialize those objects. Constructor has same name as the class itself and It should always have to be in a public mode otherwise you will not able to access them outside a class. If we do not create any constructor, then in that case compiler generates a default constructor. Let’s see how a parameterized constructor looks like</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id17/id17.9.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>There are three types of constructors in C++</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li>Default</li><li>Parameterized</li><li>Copy</li></ul>",

            "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'> I am not quite sure if you have noticed, but recently we are coming across the term META quite frequently </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Yes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp all have been specifying something about META . But what is Metaverse? Why are people excited about it ? and how can it change the society that we know? </p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The concept of Metaverse is quite simple! We as humans have evolved a lot….we are moving towards more and more engaging mediums. We started from a newspaper and now we spend most of our time watching TikToks and reels on Instagram, what comes next is the METAVERSE. Take it as an internet which you are not just looking at but inside of, suppose you are playing online games with your friends, shopping or meditating to smooth music, in metaverse everything would feel more real and more convincing. It is basically a LIVING – SHARED – EVERLASTING – VIRTUAL UNIVERSE. This will be achieved using a combination of Augmented reality and virtual reality and Mark Zuckerberg has a vision to make metaverse available to maximum amount of people and hence the cost of equipment’s needed for metaverse virtual environment will be substantially low. In my opinion this is something very cool but scary at the same time. Let me first take you through the positives</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>EXPIRENCES- </h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>On a same day you could be shooting zombies in a multiplayer game and go on a bike ride in Ladakh at a comfort and safety of staying at home.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>EXPRESSIONS-</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>There are some talks that metaverse will include expressions of your character which would be achieved using special devices. You now have a profile picture but in METAVERSE you would have an Avatar of your own and not just some cartoonish character a real-world looking character</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id18/id18.1.jpeg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>[Original METAVERSE character (source: Metaverse briefing)]</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>KNOWLEDGE- </h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well libraries are old fashioned right ?.who would take all the trouble when you could just google it. But googling will be just old fashioned in the METAVERSE as libraries, you could be able to feel and touch things be more interactive. You can travel anywhere in the world…. Hell ya ! you could be there when the industrial revolution took place or when Sir Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon…. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'> PRODUCTIVITY-</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well if knowledge increases so does productivity. </p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>ECONOMY </h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Meta is building its own store where you could purchase things for your virtual environment. To your surprise many big brands like GUCCI have actually started working for their stores in META. Most of these transactions would be done using CRYPTO-CURRENCIES in turn boost the crypto market.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Well, that’s that, but METAVERSE is actually quite scary Let us take DATA ! we all know Facebooks relationship with handling user data is quite bad and that too when we were somewhat involved with the social media but just think in METAVAERSE you are completely involved….its not just your photo or your location but it is WHOLE YOU ! that is where things get pretty serious about the metaverse</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>What is REAL ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In an era of virtual reality that almost feels real we will actually forget what’s real….Lets take the Facebooks algorithm we are been shown ONLY those things that we agree on….even you must had noticed it…suppose if you don’t like Pigeons in your METAVERSE they will not be there. If you believe there is no COVID, well in your METAVERSE it will not exist.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>SECURITY-</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Suppose you (AVATAR) are in a disco with some strangers using meta as well, now you don’t really know who that person is maybe he is a criminal dancing just besides you. What if your friends account gets hacked and behind the avatar he is not your friend but some douchebag talking to you.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>Last but the most important WHAT ABOUT US ?</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>What happens at the end of the day? We are just as normal as we were before…. You are maybe the savior of the world in the virtual reality game, or your avatar has perfect body, cool hair, great voice but at the end of the day you are just YOU…. right? Wouldn’t that affect a person’s mental health ?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>MANY QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ANSWERED BEFORE METAVERSE GOES FULLFLEGED PUBLIC !</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Believe me it is not just Facebook, many big companies are being working on it. Facebook is just the first to take the dip in the ocean.</p>",

            "blogContent": "<p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In today's world, we are facing a lot of under-the-table corruption and due to this corruption, there is a lot of black money transactions which is stored in some or the other databases. But we don't consider these databases as reliable as there is no centralized access and the admin of these databases can change the data anytime which is immensely risky and lacks security. So we need such a decentralized system and the authority of this system is been shared by all the users. Also, any malpractices, temperance, and interference with the data can be avoided with such an advanced system or database called a BlockChain.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>What is Blockchain Technology?</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Blockchain is an underlying technology behind Bitcoin and Etherum.In simple words, Blockchain is a continuously updated record of who holds what. These records are stored in different blocks, secured using cryptography, and linked together in the form of chains and that's how it's named BlockChain. Cryptography means the records are encrypted with the help of a code that ensures security to the user. This list of records, known as the distributed ledger is decentralized and is available for everyone to see and verify. In addition, the BlockChain is tamper-free and unhackable due to its distributed nature. If any tampering or editing is tried by any of the users then the request is been rejected by other members in the distributed system and hence no changes can be made in the BlockChain.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id19/id19.1.jpg' alt=''><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>History of BlockChain</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>BlockChain was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta, two researchers who needed such a system in which the data like document timestamps cannot be hampered by anyone. But it took around two decades for the actual implementation of the idea. In 2009, an unknown developer named Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin through the implementation of BlockChain and that was when the real-world application of BlockChain came into existence. Later, the boom of BlockChain proliferated exponentially and is still ruling the world.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Most people think that BlockChain is for criminal-minded and anti-government people. But the hard truth is, BlockChain is far beyond cryptos and has numerous other applications.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id19/id19.2.jpg' alt=''><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id19/id19.3.jpg' alt=''><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>Importance of BlockChain</h3><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>1. Why prefer cryptocurrency over normal Bank Transactions?</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Normal bank transactions are more prone to frauds whereas there are no chances of frauds in cryptocurrency as the central government cannot counterfeit with the cryptocurrency as it does with normal paper currency. There are many ways by which a bank transaction can fail but there are no chances of cryptocurrency transactions to be failed. Some technical issues can occur in bank transactions during the money transfer which can even lead to loss of money. Also, there are many cases of a bank account being hacked. Alongside, the Bank account has some transfer limits and charge for high transfer charges. On the other hand, there are no such constraints on cryptocurrency transactions.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>2.BlockChain-The next stage of the Internet</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>BlockChain is even considered the next generation of the Internet by many researchers and businessmen as it holds vast potentials for business, society, and individuals.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let's understand how?</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Presently, the Internet is working on the concept of copying and distributing information. For example, if you are watching a YouTube video or checking out your mail, then you are looking at the digital copy of the original. This is called double-spending. Double spending was one of the major hurdles in the development of digital currency and one day in 2008, it wasn't a problem anymore. Now people can transfer money, trade securities, buy and sell assets, using digital currency without the need of any middlemen.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id19/id19.4.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Double spending</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>3. FITS model of BlockChain application</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>FITS is an acronym for Fraud-Intermediate-Troughput-Stable data. It highly focuses on areas with a high propensity of frauds and then BlockChain helps in reducing those frauds. It can be used to eliminate middlemen where intermediaries do not provide value any more. BlockChain needs stable data as it needs to stay in the chain for a long period.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id19/id19.5.jpg' alt=''><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>FITS Model</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>4. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations(DAOs)</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Internet is emerging as a new technological era as web2.0 due to the advancement of BlockChain technologies leading to technological, economic, and social innovations such as digital currencies, distributed ledger's BlockChain IoT systems that will remodel industries from finance to insurance and energy to cybersecurity.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>5. Tokenization</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Tokenization is the process by which a physical or virtual asset or commodity can be digitally represented. In simple words, If you have a digital token or value that represents 1/1000 the value of your home and that 1000 tokens equal the entire value of your home and you have a token that represents a piece of that physical asset that you own.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>6. How do security and Transparency both go hand in hand?</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>As the record is stored in the encrypted form no one can access the data and make changes to it. As the BlockChain technology works on the decentralized method, the information is transparent to all the participants and if there is any discrepancy or anyone is trying to reach out to the data, permission is asked to all the existing participants and if the permission is approved by all the participants then the data is accessible and if the request is rejected then no access is available.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>7.BlockChain is cost-effective than the traditional economic models</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>BlockChain involves no third-party individual or middlemen to perform duties like digital payments, for insurance claims, for asset management, for the stock exchange, for land registry, and many more, and the transactions occur directly from one individual to another by reducing the cost and commission of the middleman.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>8. Prevention of data leak and hacking</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>There have been many cases in the past that have broken the trust of people from companies. But in cryptocurrency, there are fewer possibilities of data hacks and leaks.</p><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>9.BlockChain and IoT</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Blockchain is considered to be an encrypted, distributed, decentralized system created to facilitate tamper-proof, real-time records. IoT is used to describe the interconnection of computing devices embedded in day-to-day objects through the Internet that helps them to send and receive data. When you merge these two technologies, you create a model for a reliable, secure, and permanent method of recording data. Blockchain makes IoT devices more powerful by enhancing their security and transparency in the IoT ecosystems.</p><img class='img-fluid rounded' src='assets/images/General/id19/id19.6.jpg' alt=''><h4 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-4'>10. Digital Footprint</h4><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>The footprints of all the digital assets can be traced back to the beginning ranging from the banking industry to the HealthCare sector. In healthcare, it helps to trace the medical conditions of patients over a while. In the banking industry, it will help to understand the transactional behavior and financial ability of a person to decide on giving a loan or services, etc.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>I hope you will gain a clear insight about BlockChain through this Blog.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Thanks for reading!!</p>",

This virtual world has led us to multiple good destinations for a better and bright future, but it also has negative perks that no one can avoid. Each of us is experiencing the negative side of these good happenings in our day-to-day life as we are available virtually everywhere, so our life is! But while being everywhere practically, we have to keep in mind that <b>'We have to take preventive measures to have a safe and peaceful virtual life.'</b></p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>I use multiple electronic devices to walk with the generation of technology that humankind is using; I take conscious precautions to avoid certain things.

When hacking someone else’s account, strong passwords of more than eight characters of different types of keys keep our account safe and not easily accessible to any illegal hacker. And sometimes, we readily share our passwords with our closed ones, which is not good. We never know how someone can use our personal information for doing something fraudulent!</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>3. Never use public WiFi while accessing personal or financial data:</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>While traveling, we often use public WiFi to access our personal or financial data; this also leads to hacking our phones and using our personal and financial information illegally. Rather than using public WiFi, use VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection. It secures your device information and does not share them with other sites or apps.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>4. Turn off the services you don't need:</h3><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>We use Google Maps while traveling, but we forget to turn off the GPS (Global Positioning System) when it is of no use. Google Maps or any other location-tracking app keeps tracking our location and saves the data, which someone can use for creating a mishap for us. So the right thing is to turn it off when it is of no use.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>5. Be careful of what you are downloading on your device:</h3> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>We download various documents from different sites which are not even protected. The sites use malware, and when we download the files from there, the malware automatically comes to our system, which damages our system and sometimes tracks our storage and shares it with a third party that is illegal and uncons titutional. For example, the Tik Tok app, which the Government of India banned, was used to track user's information and share the user's private information with a third party. The specifics of information sharing were given in ‘terms of use’ confusingly but revealed later.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>6. Practice safe browsing:</h3> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Some apps have different functions but still ask to access and manage our phone logs, gallery photos, messages, etc. It is significant to be aware of such permissions. Even some websites use cookies for functioning, and when we open that website, a pop-up message asks us to accept those cookies. Only accept cookies if that website’s IP (Internet Protocol) address shows a lock symbol. Always practice safe and secure browsing.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>7. Always have an Antivirus on your device and keep them updated:</h3> <p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Antivirus software protects our device from harmful viruses and malware. When we keep them up-to-date, they scan our machine and notify us immediately if any virus or malware is present in our system or damaging our data. Always have antivirus updates on your phone, which you can use for your device’s safety.</p><h3 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>These are some of the practices I follow while browsing the internet. I hope you will follow them too. Have a happy and safe cyberspace:)</h3>",

Goddard.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>We spend hours fictionalizing scenarios in our head, be it winning that prestigious institute award or inventing something truly remarkable. Imagination is what keeps us mortals warm-blooded. For me, imagination is a safe space to be expressive without fearing the extremities. One such byproduct of humans being expressive is Technology, which has proven to be a means to bring visions to materiality. Furthermore the amalgamation of technology and creativity brought science fiction. Since the 19th-century science fiction is seen as a prototype of the future. Many sci-fi concepts like 3D printers, artificial intelligence etc. have made it to our world. Lately, one theory in particular has got the entire world googling.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>In April 2020, two well known personalities from the music industry - Travis Scott and Marshmello had their concert inside a video game, fortnite participated by 10.7 million people. Politicians were also seen going virtual in 2020, the Biden Harris campaign launched a map in fortnite. The news that really exposed us all to a famed concept was On 28th October, 2021 when headlines read as, “Facebook has rebranded itself as Meta”. A concept “beyond the universe”. Metaverse, a successor to the Internet, was first seen in Snow Crash - a science fiction novel written by Neal Stephenson. It is estimated that the metaverse will be built in 10 years. It is believed to completely change the way we are networking today.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Metaverse in a lay man’s terms can be described as a take on a three-dimensional world. A virtual space where every individual will be represented by their respective avatars and can be together with their geographically distant friends, play games, teleport, socialize, buy and sell land, work, invest and what not. For instance, imagine attending your favourite band’s concert with a pal who is miles away from you in just a few steps. Major technologies used for metaverse are virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. Basically, if one has played video games, one is fairly familiar with this. Point to be noted here is that metaverse does not exist as of yet.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Companies from Microsoft to Nvidia are diving deeper into this every second. The metaverse market which was worth 46 billion dollars in 2020 is estimated to reach 800 billion dollars by the year 2024. Talking about Facebook, it has created 10,000 jobs and itself invested 10 billion dollars on metaverse. Epic games and roblox are seen leading this race of creating realistic virtual realms. Upcoming video games that are bent more towards virtual three-dimensional worlds are set to reach greater engagements and growth.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>While metaverse is at a very nascent stage, there is lots of potential just in the idea of it. Just like any other technology having both benefits and concerns, metaverse will have it too. This is just a small strive towards giving a new structure to our society. A good deal of challenges are yet to be faced. For the present, let’s come together and embrace this journey of beholding Neal Stephenson’s inventiveness slowly but surely come alive.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>“Science fiction is not quirky anymore, we live in a futuristic world now” - Bonnie Hammer.</p>",

It is an imperative programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in year 1972. It is a compiled language. It is popular language because it is easy to use, memory convenient and simple to use, so many programmers decide to learn C language before Python or Java. It also offers many features and functionalities to the programmers. Many programmers still use the C language to develop various applications, games, etc.</p><h2 class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Features of C Programming:</h2><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It provides many features they are as follows:</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Fast and Effective: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>As C is compiler-based programming language it compiles and executes faster than Java or Python because they are interpreted programming language.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Procedural Language: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>People can write their programs as a series of step-by-step instructions.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Memory Management: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>It has the feature of dynamic memory allocation, which can free the allocate memory at any time by calling free() function.</p><ul class='fs-5 mb-4'> <li class='fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5'>Case sensitive: </li></ul><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>C programming language is case sensitive.

You need a cohesive design, an understandable user experience, well-structured HTML, memorable class names and well organized style sheets. Now all of this is going to take time and can be very tedious and there are a lot of ways that it can go wrong and a poor user interface can lead to poor user adoption. Now there's a solution to all of this, a CSS framework, a library of pre-built UI components with web standards and best practices built right in.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>But if you are looking to save time and energy not all CSS frameworks are going to be created equally, some are going to be less well documented and take a longer time to learn and be tougher to use.

We get emails everyday, some of them are useful while some are spam. Here our spam detection sorts the spam mails in a different folder. Also we get recommendations of videos in YouTube or Netflix based on our preference or the stuff we have previously watched. These are all the provisions we enjoy in our day-to- day life thanks to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>There is a term called Reinforcement Learning in AIML. Here machines are sanctioned to learn from mistakes or experiences they make while problem solving so that they can find the best possible method to solve the particular problem. We make them to <b>EXPLOIT</b> and <b>EXPLORE</b>, to gain many new things by taking risks sometimes.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>AIML is a key which unlocks the door of solutions to many global or local problems. In near future, machines can be a helping hand to humans. In conclusion AIML is a tech field to help humans with problem solving or decision making.</p><p class='fs-5 mb-4'>Let me know, how interesting you found AIML to be? And can a machine flip pancake for you, what do you think???</p>",
